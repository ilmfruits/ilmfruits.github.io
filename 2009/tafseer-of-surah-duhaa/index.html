    <title>Tafseer of Surah Duhaa - Ilm Fruits</title>

Then for a while, nothing. Umm Jameelah, the wife of Abu Lahab, came to him and said: &amp;#8220;I hope your shaytaan has finally left you.&amp;#8221; Because the Arabs used to say, if someone was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good at something, that they had a shaytaan helping them. (No doubt like some of the musicians today.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still nothing came. The people began to talk &amp;#8230; and they said, maybe his Lord has left him. Maybe He has abandoned him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so Allah revealed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Surah Duhaa, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;وَالضُّحَى&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By duhaa (the morning brightness after Fajr), and [by] the night when it covers with darkness, your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muúammad], nor has He detested [you].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This hadith is found in Bukhari and Muslim, and is quoted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=93&amp;amp;tid=58628&#34;&gt;Tafseer ibn Katheer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows us two things: first, that the people &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; when revelation came; that it was a big deal, and everybody knew about it.

  Islam is about social service and shukr (thankfulness).

<p>Still nothing came. The people began to talk &#8230; and they said, maybe his Lord has left him. Maybe He has abandoned him.</p>

<div class="imageCaption">
  Islam is about social service and shukr (thankfulness).
</div>

<p>Insha&#8217;Allah in this post, we&#8217;re going to discuss three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>The close relationship between Allah and His prophet</li>
<li>A glimpse of Paradise</li>
<li>A core theme of social services in Islam</li>
</ol>

<p>The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) received revelation prior to Surah Duhaa. Then for a while, nothing. Umm Jameelah, the wife of Abu Lahab, came to him and said: &#8220;I hope your shaytaan has finally left you.&#8221; Because the Arabs used to say, if someone was <em>really</em> good at something, that they had a shaytaan helping them. (No doubt like some of the musicians today.)</p>

<p>Still nothing came. The people began to talk &#8230; and they said, maybe his Lord has left him. Maybe He has abandoned him.</p>

<p>And so Allah revealed:</p>

<p>In Surah Duhaa, Allah says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>وَالضُّحَى</p>

<p>وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى</p>

<p>مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> By duhaa (the morning brightness after Fajr), and [by] the night when it covers with darkness, your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muúammad], nor has He detested [you].</p>

<p>[This hadith is found in Bukhari and Muslim, and is quoted in <a href="http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=93&amp;tid=58628">Tafseer ibn Katheer</a>]</p>

<p>This shows us two things: first, that the people <em>knew</em> when revelation came; that it was a big deal, and everybody knew about it. And second, <span class="gem">the immense love of Allah for His prophet.</span> How close their relationship&#8211;that even something as small as this stress, Allah revealed verses on behalf of the prophet, to reassure him. Subhanallah!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, Allah <em>swears</em> by duhaa&#8211;by the brightness of the day right after the sun has come up&#8211;and by the night, as it covers up the day with darkness. (This shows the greatness of these creations&#8211;that Allah swears by them. Who would deny these things? Nobody!)</p>

<p></p>

<p>In ayahs four and five, Allah says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>وَلَلْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ الْأُولَى</p>

<p>وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life]. And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.</p>

<p>Fa tardaa&#8211;and you will be satisifed. Think about it. What would make you satisfied? A wife? A car? A 3-story mansion, with a yacht, and a BMW, and a private helicopter, and &#8230;</p>

<p>The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said in one hadith: &#8220;If the son of Adam (the human being) had two valley of money, he would wish for a third, for nothing can fill the belly of Adam&#8217;s son except dust, and Allah forgives him who repents to Him.&#8221; [<a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/076.sbt.html#008.076.444">Saheeh Bukhari</a>]</p>

<p>Dust meaning&#8211;death. That he will not be satisfied until he dies; that&#8217;s the end of all those desires.</p>

<p>Yet Allah says here: tardaa, that he <em>will</em> be pleased with what Allah gives him in the hereafter. From other ahadith, we know that Allah will give the person <em>equal to the WHOLE EARTH</em>&#8211;and the person will say he&#8217;s pleased. And Allah will give more. And more. And more&#8211;until He&#8217;s given <em>ten times</em> the Earth and everything in it, to the <em>lowest</em> person in Paradise. Subhanallah! <em>fa tardaa!</em></p>

<p>Then Allah continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً فَآوَى</p>

<p>وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالّاً فَهَدَى</p>

<p>وَوَجَدَكَ عَائِلاً فَأَغْنَى</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge? And He found you lost and guided [you]? And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient?</p>

<p>These are verses that apply to the Prophet (except daalan, which means &#8220;unaware,&#8221; not misguided, in his case), but they also apply to <em>us</em>. Maybe you weren&#8217;t yateem, but weren&#8217;t we all misguided, and Allah guided us? And weren&#8217;t we poor&#8211;born without a penny to our name, no bank account, debit card, credit card, chequing account&#8211;and he made us wealthy?</p>

<p>In fact, the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) was <em>so</em> wealthy, that once, he had a whole <em>valley</em> full of sheep. This one guy was looking at it. So the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, do you like it? The man said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; The Prophet said: It&#8217;s yours. Take ALL of it.</p>

<p>So the man went home to his tribe, with this huge valley full of sheep (that&#8217;s like multi-millionaire right there), and he said: &#8220;become Muslim, because Muhammad does not fear poverty.&#8221; [Paraphrased]</p>

<p>And these verses are in a question form. Allah wants us to think about these things, and to answer these questions. Weren&#8217;t you poor, and we enriched you? It&#8217;s almost forcing the person to acknowledge the blessings and say, &#8220;yes yaa rabbi, yes o my Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then what? What is the logical conclusion? Allah says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>فَأَمَّا الْيَتِيمَ فَلَا تَقْهَرْ</p>

<p>وَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ</p>

<p>وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> So as for the orphan, do not oppress [him]. And as for the asker, do not repel [him]. And as for the favor of your Lord, report [it].</p>

<p><em>This</em> is what it&#8217;s all about. Allah gave you these blessings. Why? So you can take care of the orphans, and those who ask; Islam is really entrenched in social-services.</p>

<p>Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.</p>

<p><strong>Arabic Analysis:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ad-Duhaa (الضُّحَى):</strong> The time of day <em>right</em> after Fajr, when the sun is just rising, up until Dhur time. Well-known because of Salaatul-Duhaa, the nafl salah of that time.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Layl (اللَّيْل):</strong> The night. Sometimes comes in the feminine form laylah (with ta-marbuwtah). Same meaning in either case.</li>
<li><strong>Wadda&#8217;a ( وَدَّعَ):</strong> Left, abandoned; it&#8217;s baab-two, the more intensive form of wada&#8217;a.</li>
<li><strong>Qalaa (قَلَى):</strong> He hated. Not to be confused with qaala (قال), which means &#8220;he said.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Khayr (خَيْرٌ):</strong> It means &#8220;good.&#8221; Here, it&#8217;s ism tafdeel&#8211;the comparative particle. Here, it means &#8220;better.&#8221; The akhirah is <em>khayr</em> than the dunya.</li>
<li><strong>Yateem (يَتِيم):</strong> Someone who is under the age of puberty and who&#8217;s father has passed away. Even if their mother is still alive, they&#8217;re yateem if their father is not; and once they hit puberty, they&#8217;re not yateem anymore, and all the rulings etc. change.</li>
<li><strong>Saa&#8217;il (سَائِل):</strong> Is on the pattern of faa&#8217;il, the doer, or the one who does an action continuously. Saa&#8217;il is from sa&#8217;ala, to ask; it means &#8220;the asker.&#8221; Based on this ayah, some &#8216;ulama say, if someone is truly needy and they ask, don&#8217;t repulse them&#8211;don&#8217;t swear at them and hit them and that sort of thing. Do not repel them harshly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Social Service.</strong> Make a pledge to yourself to do some sort of social service. Volunteer in a soup kitchen, donate to <a href="http://orphanrun.com/">Orphan Run</a>, something! If you&#8217;re in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area), the AlMaghrib qabeelah there regularly engages in social services (feeding the poor, food drives, etc.), as do <a href="http://web.youngmuslims.ca/activities/service.html">Young Muslims</a> (blood-drives, feeding the poor, etc.) Hook up and help out regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect on Paradise.</strong> Reflect on the things you like in this life&#8211;good food, company, entertainment; and in the Akhirah, there is only MORE, and BETTER quality. Reflect on that. Think about it. Fa tardaa! Anything you could possibly desire &#8230; and more. Yours. For you.</li>
<li><strong>Comment on your reflections.</strong> What one thing about Paradise really hits you in the heart and motivates you to work for it?</li>
</ul>
