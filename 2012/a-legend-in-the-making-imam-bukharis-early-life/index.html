  </header>

  

  <div class="article-body">

<p>Imam Bukhari, rahimahullah, is now a well-known scholar because of his <em>saheeh</em> collection of ahadith. It took him years to finish. But, this was not the beginning of his fame; in fact, the Muslims and scholars saw, from an early time, his intellectual strength and capability; he achieved fame well before he completed his most famous book.</p>

<p>Now, let us breeze through some details about the early life of this great scholar.</p>

<h3 id="a-mistake-in-the-chain-age-11">A Mistake in the Chain: Age 11</h3>

<p>Imam Bukhari began to sit in circles of knowledge early &#8212; as early as eleven years of age. To sit in these circles, you need to first memorize the Qur&#8217;an; so we know he memorized it quite early in his life.</p>

<p>In those early days of Islam, the society and culture was still very much based out of oral tradition &#8212; people would memorize and narrate more than they would write. At that time, for a teacher to appear with written notes would be an embarrassment; teachers always taught from memory.</p>

<p>As Imam Bukhari sat in class, the teacher made a mistake in the name of one narrator of the chain. Imam Bukhari pointed this out. His teacher, embarrassed, consulted his notes; and sure enough, found that he made a mistake in the name of the narrator.</p>

<p>Even from age 11, Imam Bukhari accumulated fame; not just as a parrot memorizer of information, but as an analytical mind. We see here that he thought critically about the chain of narration (which is how he found the mistake.)</p>

<h3 id="labayka-allahumma-labayk-age-16">Labayka Allahumma Labayk: Age 16</h3>

<p>At age 16, Imam Bukhari&#8217;s mother took him and his older brother for Hajj. Upon his arrival in Mecca, Imam Bukhari loved the city &#8212; not just the &#8216;ibaadah, the rites of Hajj and umrah, but the knowledge.</p>

<p>The greatest centers of Islamic learning during his time included Mecca and Medina. Hajj is something you do once in a lifetime. The trip itself takes several months; you might never come again. Scholars normally stayed a minimum of five to six months, if not several years, before returning home. And scholars congregate from around the world, every year, to these two cities.</p>

<p>Halaqaat (teaching circles) of knowledge abounded everywhere, with scholars from Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, etc. and all over the world, all exchanging and trading knowledge. It was normal to spend 4-5 years there before returning home.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for Imam Bukhari? As a student of knowledge, Mecca became one of the best places you can visit. You don&#8217;t have to travel to seek knowledge &#8212; scholars come to you, in Mecca and Medinah. The international scholarship mesmerized Imam Bukhari.</p>

<p>He begged his mother to allow him to stay, and seeing his excitement, she agreed; his older brother accompanied her home. (This is how we know he <em>has</em> an older brother &#8212; from this incident; he has no known other siblings.)</p>

<p>Also, Allah blessed Imam Bukhari&#8217;s mother with wealth; she could afford to not have her son work. This enabled him to study the deen full time; he only returned home at the end of his life.</p>

<h3 id="his-first-book-age-18">His First Book: Age 18</h3>

<p>At age 18 (the age we normally finish high school and start university), Imam Bukhari completed his first book, entitled &#8220;Qadaayah As-Sahaba&#8221; (rulings of the sahaba). Other books followed; by age 19, he wrote At-Tareekh Al-Kabeer, one of the most important books on the science of hadith until today; he completed all nine volumes by age 19.</p>

<p>At-Tareekh Al-Kabeer literally translates to &#8220;The Big History.&#8221; History, to Imam Bukhari, included the names of narrators of hadith. This nine volume compendium documents the names of <em>every single narrator of hadith from the time of rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) to Imam Bukhari&#8217;s time.</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s a lot. And this is one of the most advanced sciences within the science of hadith, called &#8220;Ilm Al-Rijaal&#8221; (knowledge of men). In Medinah U, they study this topic in a full class. Imam Bukhari, at age 18-19, wrote a foundational book in his field; we still use that book as a reference today &#8212; even scholars in their sixties and seventies, use 18-year-old Bukhari&#8217;s book to figure out who narrators are.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, his fame and aptitude spread. And no doubt, Allah blessed him with many blessings, including his aptitude in memorization; he had a very clear, strong, photographic memory &#8212; as we mentioned in <a href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/2012/imam-bukharis-memory-in-the-test-of-baghdad/">the story of his test in Baghdad</a>. He would read a page once, and memorize it, immediately.</p>

<p>That summarizes the early life of Imam Bukhari. He also travelled extensively during his early years; he sought knowledge in Mecca and Medinah, as well as Baghdad, Kufa, Egypt, and other major cities and major learning centres.</p>

<p>And that summarizes the early life of Imam Bukhari, rahimahullah.</p>
