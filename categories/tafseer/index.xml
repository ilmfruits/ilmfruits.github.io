      <title>How to Pass Tests: Lessons from the Du’a of Prophet Ibrahim</title>

      <description>In Surah Al-Anbiyaa, Allah says:
Translation: Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned. (Surah Al-Anbiya, verse 35)
In this verse, Allah uses the word &amp;#8220;nablukum&amp;#8221; (نبلوكم). This is a present-tense (mudaari&amp;#8217;) form of the word &amp;#8220;balaa.&amp;#8221; From the grammar itself, scholars note, this means that Allah says that he will test you again and again and again, continuously.</description>

      <title>The Significance of Seven in Arab Culture</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2012/the-significance-of-seven-in-arab-culture/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2012/the-significance-of-seven-in-arab-culture/</guid>
      <description>One of the things we need to understand about Arabic culutre is the significance of the number &amp;#8220;seven.&amp;#8221; This boils over into our understanding of ahadith.
First, a strong disclaimer: Islam has nothing to do with numerology &amp;#8212; that is, the study and assignment of arbitrary numbers to the value of letters of the Arabic alphabet &amp;#8212; such as the popular &amp;#8220;786&amp;#8221; which represents &amp;#8220;bismillah.&amp;#8221;
Nor should numbers be interpreted symbolically or otherwise, unless there is a very good, strong reason for doing so &amp;#8212; such as with number seven.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Nazi’at, Part 2</title>

      <description>This is post #43 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Continuing into our foray of tafseer of Surah An-Nazi&amp;#8217;aat, we reach the story of Musa (alayhi salaam). Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰ
 Translation: Has there reached you the story of Moses? [Surah Naazi&amp;#8217;aat, verse 15]
One of the interesting aspects of Qur&amp;#8217;an you don&amp;#8217;t get from the translation is discourse.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Nazi’at, Part 1</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2011/tafseer-surah-naziat-part-1/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This is post #42 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, insha&amp;#8217;Allah we will take a whirlwind tour of the first third or so of Surah Naazi&amp;#8217;aat, a great and powerful surah of the Qur&amp;#8217;an. Then insha&amp;#8217;Allah we will go back and dive into more details (particularly in the Arabic side of things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّازِعَاتِ غَرْقًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّاشِطَاتِ نَشْطًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالسَّابِحَاتِ سَبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالسَّابِقَاتِ سَبْقًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُدَبِّرَاتِ أَمْرًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By those [angels] who extract with violence, and [by] those who remove with ease, and [by] those who glide [as if] swimming, and those who race each other in a race, and those who arrange [each] matter, &amp;#8230; [Surah Nazi&amp;#8217;at, verses 1-5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ayaat describe attributes of angels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripping Out:&lt;/strong&gt; Gharq (غَرْق) means to rip out, to yank out, to extract harshly. If you had a tree and you uprooted it, roots and all, that would be gharq. This refers to the angels who remove the souls of the corrupt and the evil-doers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gently Pulling:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse two contrasts verse one by mentioning nasht (نَشْط), which is like a gentle pulling. This refers to the angels that remove the souls of the righteous believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swimming:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse three refers to angels who &lt;em&gt;swim through the air&lt;/em&gt;; they are described as swimming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racing:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse four refers to angels who are racing; racing the souls of the righteous to Jannah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al-Mudabiraat:&lt;/strong&gt; Al-Mudabiraat are those angelswho settle the affairs of deen and dunya, in the dunya. They take care of floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters, among other things. Their name, al-mudabiraat, also implies that they are thorough planners and executers of those plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are &lt;em&gt;aqsaam&lt;/em&gt; (oaths), which is typical in Mecci surahs. What is Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) swearing to?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tafseer Surah Naba’, Part 3: Contemplate</title>

      <description>This is post #41 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In the previous two posts, we discussed the first three quarters of this juz; now, we move into the final quarter. After describing some of the punishments of Hellfire, Allah says:
 إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا
حَدَائِقَ وَأَعْنَابًا
وَكَوَاعِبَ أَتْرَابًا
وَكَأْسًا دِهَاقً
لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا كِذَّابًا
 Translation: Indeed, for the righteous is attainment/success &amp;#8211; gardens and grapevines, and full-breasted [companions] of equal age, and a full cup.</description>

      <description>This is post #40 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In the previous post, we discussed the first 16 verses of Surah Naba&amp;#8217;. The remaining 24 verses discuss the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire; you should read them to extract the details. Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;re going to touch on a few points that are interesting.
First, a recap&amp;#8211;verse 16 talked about (a continuing discussion of) some of the blessings of Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) in the dunya on the people.</description>

      <description>This is post #39 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
The tafseer of Surah Naba&amp;#8217; really speaks for itself; it talks about the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire&amp;#8211;three strong, recurring themes in the last juz. And this is, of course, the first surah in Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Therefore, we&amp;#8217;re going to focus mostly on the linguistic meaning of the words in the verses, and some gleams of tafseer you might not extract from just reading the verses in Arabic.</description>

      <description>This is post #38 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says in Surah Al-Ghaashiyah:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ
 Translation: Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming [event]? [Surah Ghashiya, verse 1]
The surah starts with a question, to make you think. The companions would say: Allahu wa rasuluhu a&amp;#8217;lam (know better), out of humbleness, even know they had an answer in mind.</description>

      <description>This is post #37 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Allah says, in Surah Tariq:
 وَالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ
وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ
النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ
 Translation: By the sky and the night comer (At-Tariq), And what can make you know what is the night comer? It is the piercing star. [Surah At-Taariq, verses 1-3]
As we mentioned before, one of the characteristics of early and Mecci surahs, like this one, is that they begin with a qasam &amp;#8212; an oath, a testification.</description>

Allah subhaanhu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an (the meaning of which is):
 &amp;#8220;(It was said to his son): &amp;#8220;O Yahya (John)! Hold fast the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)].&amp;#8221; And We gave him wisdom while yet a child. And (made him) sympathetic to men as a mercy (or a grant) from Us, and pure from sins [i.e. Yahya (John)] and he was righteous, and dutiful towards his parents, and he was neither an arrogant nor disobedient (to Allah or to his parents).</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Humazah: The Crusher</title>

      <description>This is post #36 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In Surah Humazah, Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ
 Translation: Woe to every scorner (humazah) and mocker (lumazah). [Surah Al-Humaza, verse 1].
As we mentioned many, many times before in this series, wayl is a curse. And when Allah says wayl about someone, it&amp;#8217;s not a curse, but a statement of reality&amp;#8211;because He, &amp;#8216;azza wa jal, is not in need of cursing anyone.</description>

In this post, we will insha&amp;#8217;Allah do a word-for-word breakdown of each surah, as space permits.
In the first ayah, Allah (subhannahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala) says:
 لَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَٰذَا الْبَلَدِ
 The first two words, laa uqsimu (لَا أُقْسِمُ) literally means &amp;#8220;I do not swear.&amp;#8221; Uqsimu is mudaari&amp;#8217; mutakallim waahid, i.</description>

The CN Tower, 150 stories high. Fa laa iqtahamaa al-aqabah.  Continuing our discussion of Surah Balad, Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ
وَلِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ
وَهَدَيْنَاهُ النَّجْدَيْنِ

Allah says:
 لَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَذَا الْبَلَدِ
 Translation: I swear by this city (Makkah) &amp;#8230; [Surah Balad, verse 1]
&amp;#8220;Laa uqsim&amp;#8221; literally means, &amp;#8220;I will not swear by.&amp;#8221; in Arabic language, it means &amp;#8220;this thing is so truthful, I almost don&amp;#8217;t even have to swear by it.</description>

This post is chronologically out of order, since Surah Quraish was revealed before surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah; but insha&amp;#8217;Allah khayr. Allah says:
 لِإِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ
إِيلَافِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَاءِ وَالصَّيْفِ
فَلْيَعْبُدُوا رَبَّ هَذَا الْبَيْتِ
الَّذِي أَطْعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٍ وَآمَنَهُم مِّنْ خَوْفٍ
 Translation: For the accustomed security of the Quraysh &amp;#8211; Their accustomed security [in] the caravan of winter and summer &amp;#8211; Let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.</description>

As per the poll on our twitter account, there was consensus on their being a post on grammatical analysis of Surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah. So here you go insha&amp;#8217;Allah.
Standard Disclaimer: I am not an Arab (as in, fluent in Arabic) nor have I double-checked this in books of &amp;#8216;ulama discussing grammar; there is sometimes difference of opinion in grammar, as well; so take it as such insha&amp;#8217;Allah.</description>

&lt;p&gt;وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the sky containing great stars. And [by] the promised Day. And [by] the witness and what is witnessed. Cursed were the companions of the trench. [Surah Al-Buruj, verses 1-4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Ashaab-ul-Burooj, the People of the Ditch, is pretty well-known; in fact, we have an &lt;a href=&#34;the-people-of-the-ditch&#34;&gt;entire 15-part series&lt;/a&gt; on this surah. Check it out insha&amp;#8217;Allah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah opens this surahs with testifications. Then he testifies: qutila ashaabul-&amp;#8216;uqdood. &amp;#8216;uqdood is another word for ditch. Qutila, literally, means &amp;#8220;they were killed.&amp;#8221; But Ibn Abbaas (radiallahu anhu) said, whenever you read qutila in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, it means lu&amp;#8217;ina&amp;#8211;cursed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allah cursed the People of the Ditch.&lt;/strong&gt; And Allah is not in need of cursing&amp;#8211;He can do anything, to anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lu&amp;#8217;ina means, they were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they _are_destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what great sin did they perpetrate in order to deserve this immense reward&amp;#8211;not only being cursed and destroyed, but &lt;em&gt;being documented in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, to be recited until the end of time&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

The noble she-camel, prized in the Arab society, was actually one of the signs Allah sent to a nation. What did they do with it?  Surahs are usually named by something unique in their content. But the sun (ash-shams) is mentioned in several surahs; so why is this one called Surah Shams?</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Qadar: What’s Better Than 1000 Months?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is post #25 in our series on Tafseer of Juz ‘Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reason-of-revelation&#34;&gt;Reason of Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) told the companions about a man of the previous nations; a man who lived and fought jihad for over 1000 months (roughly 83 years, 4 months). (In case you didn&amp;#8217;t know, the previous nations lived longer than us&amp;#8211;like Prophet Nuh (alayhi salaam), who did da&amp;#8217;wah for nearly 1000 years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companions were amazed, and they said: how can we compete with him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And subhanallah, this is a gem. &lt;em&gt;Look at the companions.&lt;/em&gt; They &lt;strong&gt;prioritized and competed for the akhirah.&lt;/strong&gt; Subhanallah to the point that, they don&amp;#8217;t just try to do &amp;#8220;some good deeds before I die;&amp;#8221; not enough. They competed with each other&amp;#8211;but even that was not enough. Rather, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;they competed with all of the Muslims, ever, starting from the time of Prophet Adam, until the Day of Judgment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to really look at ourselves and see, how much are we like them? Or are we just vying for bigger houses, better cars&amp;#8211;more dunya?&lt;/p&gt;

  It&amp;#8217;s not dunya status that matters. Allah teaches us this again in Surah Abasa&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s the one with taqwa.

&lt;p&gt;How would you feel if someone you love corrected you, in public, in front of everyone else? Would you feel condemned, or criticized? Would you take it more seriously than someone you don&amp;#8217;t like criticizing you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if &lt;strong&gt;Allah, the Lord of the Universe,&lt;/strong&gt; criticized you &amp;#8230; in public?&lt;/p&gt;

Allah says, in Surah Tawheed, also known as Surah Ikhlas:
 قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ
لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ
وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ
 Translation: Say, &amp;#8220;He is Allah , [who is] One, Allah , the Eternal Refuge [As-Samad], He neither begets (gives birth to) nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/forest-night-light.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; title=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1233&#34; /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;The protection of Allah is easily earned and very, very powerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims love talking about Jinns and black magic. Yet, when it comes to inoculating themselves from supernatural forces, Muslims are often either ignorantly doing &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of what they need to do, or proverbially standing on the interstate highway, woefully oblivious of thousands of cars speeding by at near-miss distances. And many of us, or people we know, personally &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even the newest Muslim is often quickly equipped with powerful shields of protection against these forces. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

The Sabab-un-Nuzool (reason of revelation) for Surah Fil well-known; you can read all about it, along with some lessons and gems, in this post by Sr. Mariam 3.36. Please read it, since I won&amp;#8217;t touch on those points.
I will mention, however, two points not mentioned there&amp;#8211;that the Christian tyrant king who brought his elephant, why did he decide to destroy the Ka&amp;#8217;bah?</description>

In Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon, Allah says:
 فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ
الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ
الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #18 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series). Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;ll be kicking up the post frequency to three times a week in order to finish before Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يُكَذِّبُ بِالدِّينِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَذَلِكَ الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَى طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you seen the one who denies the Repayment? For that is the one who drives away the orphan, and does not encourage the feeding of the poor. [Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon, verses 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the connection here&amp;#8211;verse one, the one who denies Ad-Deen, the Day of Repayment. And verse two and three? He drives away orphans, He doesn&amp;#8217;t encourage feeding of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t feed&lt;/em&gt; the poor. It&amp;#8217;s that he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t encourange&lt;/em&gt; feeding the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graves &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah At-Takaathur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حَتَّى زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graveyards. [Surah At-Takaathur, verses 1-2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subhanallah, even though these verses were revealed over 1400 years ago, we still see the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; situation today. Al-Haakum means, it makes you compete with each other. At-Takaathur is rivalry, competition, in accumulating material things; thinking that life is about toys, and the one with the most (or most expensive) toys wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Takaathur?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/arabic-explanation-of-surah-takweer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #17 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/sun-in-space.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1177&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  When the sun is &lt;em&gt;kuwwirat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to digress a bit and jump back to Surah Takweer. This post is based on Shaykh Nouman Khan&amp;#8217;s tafseer, which heavily emphasizes the Arabic language. I hope you will find, as I found it, as a glimpse of a previously-unseen world, a depth of knowledge that just drips from the Arabic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in surah Takweer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; When the sun is &lt;em&gt;kuwwirat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230; [verse 1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of gems that we learn even from this first ayah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idhaa + Past-Tense:&lt;/strong&gt; Idhaa is an indicator of future-tense &amp;#8220;when (something will happen).&amp;#8221; Yet, kuwwirat is past-tense; why? This combination means &lt;strong&gt;something is so certain, it&amp;#8217;s like past-tense.&lt;/strong&gt; So Allah is saying &amp;#8220;when this happens,&amp;#8221; yet it&amp;#8217;s certain that it WILL happen; as certain as the past is past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominal Sentence:&lt;/strong&gt; The default in Arabic is to put the verb first&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;kuwwirat ash-shamsu.&amp;#8221; To reverse this into &amp;#8220;ash-shamsu kuwwirat,&amp;#8221; shows emphasis, and makes it a tougher, stronger sentence. This hints at the audience&amp;#8211;Mushrikeen in Mecca, the worst and most obstinate of them, who are listening to this revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Voice:&lt;/strong&gt; Allah could have said, &amp;#8220;When I wrap up the sun,&amp;#8221; but He didn&amp;#8217;t. Why? If you&amp;#8217;re biased against someone (say a political party), &lt;em&gt;no matter what they say&lt;/em&gt;, even before they open their mouth, you say, &amp;#8220;psshh.&amp;#8221; But here, passive-voice highlights the maf&amp;#8217;ool, the recipient of the action&amp;#8211;the sun, the stars&amp;#8211;instead of the doer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the meaning of kuwwirat, kawwara means to wrap something around something; it&amp;#8217;s used in the context of a turban, something long, that&amp;#8217;s wrapped around your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah is applying the same meaning here&amp;#8211;that the light of the sun, something that&amp;#8217;s long, will be kuwwirat, wrapped up. Wrapped up meaning, something will cover it, and it will no longer be visible; and it will be wrapped slowly, part by part disappearing&amp;#8211;the same way that Allah described the day as wrapping around the night and the night wrapping around the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something scary&amp;#8211;that you see the sun wrapped up, and losing its light. But &lt;em&gt;there&amp;#8217;s more&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #16 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-in-mountains.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1168&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Indeed, We gave you Al-Kawthar.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Al-Kauthar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice [to Him alone]. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off. [Surah Kawthar, verse 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you know the hadith where the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) was napping under a tree, and he woke up, smiling; and he said, Allah revealed to me this surah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the &amp;#8216;ulama have discussed this&amp;#8211;is it possible that Allah sends revelation in a dream? The answer is, surprisingly, &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;; of the 6-7 ways, the most common is through Jibreel (alayhi salaam). Even here, there&amp;#8217;s no indication that the surah was revealed through a dream&amp;#8211;perhaps Jibreel (alayhi salaam) came to the Prophet once he had woken, and revealed it to him. (For more information, check our posts on Route 114: Uloom Al-Qur&amp;#8217;an)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verse 1, Allah says: Inna &amp;#8216;ataynaaka al-kawthar. These two words allude to an enormous giver, giving an enormous gift. Allah could&amp;#8217;ve just said: ataytuka al-kawthar; but that would&amp;#8217;ve been weak, human speech. Instead, he uses inna&amp;#8211;emphasis, and refers to himself in the &amp;#8220;royal we&amp;#8221; (something we have in English, too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُغِيرَاتِ صُبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the &amp;#8216;aadiyaat, when they pant, and the muwriyraat striking (when their hoves strike the ground and make sparks), and the mughiyraat, at dawn (when they raid), stirring up thereby [clouds of] dust, arriving thereby in the center collectively, &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a qasam (oath), a big oath that spans five ayaat. I&amp;#8217;m going to dive into word-for-word translation, because no translation can do justice (without paragraphs of brackets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;Aadiyaat (عَادِيَات) are horses (plural: sound feminine plural, in fact). Not those horses you see Canadian Mounties riding; but real, true, WAR horses. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen war-horses (send us a picture!), they have a special, particular intensity to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dabhaa (ضَبْحًا) means to pant. Pant meaning, if you&amp;#8217;ve ever run in a 100-meter race, or tried to run until you&amp;#8217;re tired, and you start breathing heavily through your mouth&amp;#8211;that&amp;#8217;s panting. Why are the &amp;#8216;aadiyaat panting? Because they are &lt;em&gt;charging&lt;/em&gt; into battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll see lots of war concepts here. The Arabs at the time of the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) knew these things very, very well; and when Allah testifies, these things he testifies by&amp;#8211;nobody would deny them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muwriyaat (مُورِيَات) are also war-horses&amp;#8211;the ones that strike. Strike meaning, when they run, their hooves strike up sparks on the ground. I definitely don&amp;#8217;t encourage watching movies, so if you&amp;#8217;ve ever read seerah stories, or perhaps Lord of the Rings, or similar books, you might find these kinds of concepts in their battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mughiyraat (مُغِيرَات) are the raiding horses. In the time of the Prophet, they would have raids; you would see a whole army of horses and riders sweeping into a city, and they&amp;#8217;d kill everybody and destroy it. Mughiyraat are those raiding horses that they rode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Reality of Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 14th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/clock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;85741170&#34; title=&#34;85741170&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1147&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah &amp;#8216;Asr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالْعَصْرِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;By Time. Indeed, mankind is at loss. Except for those who have believed, done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.&amp;#8221; [Asr: 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah swears by time&amp;#8211;which shows how enormous and noble this creation is. Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imam Shafi said about this revelation that had it been the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; revelation sent to mankind, it would have been enough.  What motivated him to say this?&lt;/p&gt;

Stand up and do more. Muslims don&amp;#8217;t retire or quit from working for the deen. Persist. Be like the flower that springs through concrete.
Allah says, in verse 3:
 وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ
 Translation: And raised high for you your repute.

      <title>Tafseer of Surah Duhaa</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-duhaa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2009 18:24:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-duhaa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 12th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/breakfast-on-bed.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1118&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Islam is about social service and shukr (thankfulness).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insha&amp;#8217;Allah in this post, we&amp;#8217;re going to discuss three points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The close relationship between Allah and His prophet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A glimpse of Paradise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A core theme of social services in Islam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) received revelation prior to Surah Duhaa. Then for a while, nothing. Umm Jameelah, the wife of Abu Lahab, came to him and said: &amp;#8220;I hope your shaytaan has finally left you.&amp;#8221; Because the Arabs used to say, if someone was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good at something, that they had a shaytaan helping them. (No doubt like some of the musicians today.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still nothing came. The people began to talk &amp;#8230; and they said, maybe his Lord has left him. Maybe He has abandoned him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Allah revealed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Duhaa, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالضُّحَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By duhaa (the morning brightness after Fajr), and [by] the night when it covers with darkness, your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muúammad], nor has He detested [you].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This hadith is found in Bukhari and Muslim, and is quoted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=93&amp;amp;tid=58628&#34;&gt;Tafseer ibn Katheer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows us two things: first, that the people &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; when revelation came; that it was a big deal, and everybody knew about it. And second, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;the immense love of Allah for His prophet.&lt;/span&gt; How close their relationship&amp;#8211;that even something as small as this stress, Allah revealed verses on behalf of the prophet, to reassure him. Subhanallah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, Allah &lt;em&gt;swears&lt;/em&gt; by duhaa&amp;#8211;by the brightness of the day right after the sun has come up&amp;#8211;and by the night, as it covers up the day with darkness. (This shows the greatness of these creations&amp;#8211;that Allah swears by them. Who would deny these things? Nobody!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/unpacked-suitcase.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1112&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;font-size: 80%; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  What have you packed for the Hereafter?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 11th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Fajr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَأَمَّا الْإِنسَانُ إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَأَكْرَمَهُ وَنَعَّمَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَكْرَمَنِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَأَمَّا إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَهَانَنِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, &amp;#8220;My Lord has honored me.&amp;#8221; But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, &amp;#8220;My Lord has humiliated me.&amp;#8221; [Surah Fajr, verses 15-16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice here, Allah is commenting on the mentality of the human race. When Allah gives &amp;#8230; the human being says: &amp;#8220;My Lord has honoured me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#8217;s all about wealth &amp;#8230; money &amp;#8230; dunya. This is the metric we use. You see the president of a country? You&amp;#8217;re very respectful. If the same president was a homeless bum asking you for change? You wouldn&amp;#8217;t even look at him. We equate money with respect and honour &amp;#8230; as Allah points out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the flip side? When Allah constrains the rizq, the human being says: &amp;#8220;My lord has humiliated me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #10 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Layl, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَمَا خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the night when it covers, and [by] the day when it appears, and [by] He who created the male and female: &lt;em&gt;Indeed&lt;/em&gt;, your paths are diverse. [Surah Layl, verses 1-4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arabic (and in English), people talk. And when you want to really draw attention to something, you make an oath. Compare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child 1:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t break the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I swear by my mother&amp;#8217;s grave, that I didn&amp;#8217;t break the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would you pay more attention to? Obviously, the second child (by the way, don&amp;#8217;t swear by other than Allah, it&amp;#8217;s shirk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine two people talking&amp;#8211;your brother or sister, who you&amp;#8217;ve known forever, and the President of America. Who would you pay more attention to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lillahi mathalu al-&amp;#8216;alaa. This is &lt;strong&gt;Allah&lt;/strong&gt; talking to you. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; He&amp;#8217;s making an oath&amp;#8211;not just one, but three things! We should &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; pay attention here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what does He testify to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 4&amp;#8211;that your paths are different.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tafseer of Surah Al-‘Ala</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-al-ala/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:10:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-al-ala/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #9 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/tajmahal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Taj Mahal, a HUGE palace.&#34; title=&#34;The Taj Mahal, a HUGE palace.&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1082&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-&amp;#8216;Ala is one recited quite often; the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to recite it in Witr, and in Jumu&amp;#8217;ah, and in &amp;#8216;Eid; and on days when Jumuah and &amp;#8216;Eid coincide, people would hear it in &amp;#8216;Eid, then again a few hours later in Jumu&amp;#8217;ah. This indicates &lt;strong&gt;the great importance&lt;/strong&gt; of Surah Al-&amp;#8216;Ala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you probably didn&amp;#8217;t know about this surah&amp;#8211;when we say &amp;#8220;Subhanna rabbiy al-&amp;#8216;alaa&amp;#8221; in sujood, that comes from this verse&amp;#8211;because the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded us to do so. This is where it comes from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive into some of the tafseer.  In ayah 9, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #8 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/10123827.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;10123827&#34; title=&#34;10123827&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1070&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue on our journey through tafseer of Juz Amma, we come across Surah Takweer.  Surah Takweer begins with a description of the Day of Judgement.  What we have to keep in mind as we go through the surahs in chronological order is that these first surahs were teachhing big lessons and getting across major points.  In this Surah Allah t&amp;#8217;Ala tells us to think about the bigger picture.  In fact Allah t&amp;#8217;Ala &lt;strong&gt;shows&lt;/strong&gt; us what the Day of Judgement will be like.  All of this to help get our minds to focus on the big picture in life.  And what could be bigger than the  Day of Judgement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive into the verses, to understand them more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us know Surah Lahab. It&amp;#8217;s one of the first one Muslim children learn these days. We&amp;#8217;re going to breeze through the tafseer, then dive into one of the miracles, and finish up with some Arabic analysis.
Allah says:
 تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ
مَا أَغْنَى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ
سَيَصْلَى نَاراً ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ</description>

In verses 9 and 10 of Surah Iqraa, Allah says:
 أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يَنْهَى
عَبْداً إِذَا صَلَّى
 Translation: Have you seen the one who forbids a servant when he prays?
The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to make sujood to Allah in the courtyard of the ka&amp;#8217;bah in early times in Mecca, and nobody would stop him.</description>

In our last post, we talked about how the human race does taghaa if they see themselves as self-sufficient. Living in western societies, we see this all around us&amp;#8211;people racing, fighting, stealing, overworking, to make a few more dollars so that they can &amp;#8220;make it.&amp;#8221; They buy lottery tickets so they can &amp;#8220;make it&amp;#8221; and be rich, rich rich!</description>

      <description>Note: This is our 4th post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Allah says, in ayahs 6-7 of Surah Iqraa:
 كَلَّا إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَيَطْغَى
أَن رَّآهُ اسْتَغْنَى
 Translation: No! [But] indeed, man transgresses. Because he sees himself self-sufficient. [Surah Iqraa, verses 6-7]
Kalla is a very stern, emphatic warning. If your kid is being bad, you say &amp;#8220;laa, laa;&amp;#8221; and then they grab something hot off the stove and you say &amp;#8220;KALLA!</description>

      <description>Note: This is the third post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
From the opening ceremonies, to the first move of world leaders, people like to send a message. The intense revelation of the Qur’an is no different. The timing, style and content, sends a message to the final Prophet (saw) and to all of humanity.
Allah (swt) starts the revelation commanding the Prophet to read &amp;#8220;Recite in the name of your Lord who created.</description>

      <description>This is the second post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
The first five ayaat of Surah Iqraa are:
 اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ
خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ
اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الْأَكْرَمُ
الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ
عَلَّمَ الْإِنسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ
 Word-for-word translations are pretty common these days (like this one, which has Surah Iqraa), so I&amp;#8217;m going to touch lightly on that, and do a bit more grammar.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Although the story is well-known amongst the Muslims, we will recap the story of the first revelation: Surah Iqraa (also known as Surah &amp;#8216;Alaq), revealed in Mecca.
Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal (rahimahullah) relates from &amp;#8216;Aisha (radiallahu &amp;#8216;anhaa) that the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam), for six months before revelation, would see true dreams that would happen the next day&amp;#8211;day after day after day, for six months.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a beautiful du&amp;#8217;a that Allah mentions near the end of Surah Baqarah:
وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا  Translation: So do &amp;#8216;affuw on us. And forgive us. And have mercy on us. [Surah Baqarah, verse 286]
Allah mentions three things, in order:
 &amp;#8216;Affuw &amp;#8216;annaa: Affuw linguistically means to erase something; to obliterate something; to completely destroy something and leave no traces of it whatsoever. This du&amp;#8217;a is saying: make affuw of our sins.</description>

SubhanAllah! How fast Ramadan came and how fast it went. It truly saddens my heart to see this blessed month go away, to see it slipping away, to have to say good-bye. In a few days, the shayateen will be let loose and the difficulties will emerge. Ya Rabbi! Give this ummah the strength to fight the shayateen and keep us steadfast in the deen.</description>

 Recall, the greatest name of the Lord of the heavens and the earth is Allah. This is the name that He has chosen to name Himself with, and it is the grand name to which all His other Names and Attributes are attributed to.</description>

In one of the most beautiful beginnings of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala starts surah Saad with a powerful reminder. He says:
صۚ وَالْقُرْآنِ ذِي الذِّكْرِ
Saad. And by the Qur&amp;#8217;an, full of dhikr! [Surah Saad, verse 1]
This ayah begins with a letter, which are known as: huroof muqatta&amp;#8217;aat, the disjointed letters. There are many opinions as to what these letters mean, but the greatest and strongest opinion is that none but Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala knows their meanings.</description>

Sitting in a halaqah–in a khutbah–in an AlMaghrib class, learning about the deen of Allah– the emanrush, your heart just flutters with tranquility. With satisfaction. With humility. With peace.
Why do we only feel this way in these gatherings?
Allah azza wa jal provides the answer:
He says in Surah Ra’d ayah 28:الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوب

[Surah Suratul Anbiya, verse 39]
The word for ward off is &amp;#8220;yakuffoona&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;يَكُفُّونَ&amp;#8221; and this is from the root word &amp;#8220;ka-fa-fa&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;kaff&amp;#8221; which means palm/hand.</description>

      <description>Victory comes only by the decree and permission of Allah, and this is true whether the victory is a small personal victory (like meeting a personal goal), the victory of a nation (like winning a battle), or the victory of passing the tests of dunya (like overcoming temptation and lowering your gaze). The evidence that supports this rule is ample, and the quality of the evidence—subhaanAllah, the stories are amazing! One such story comes from Suratul-Fil (The Elephant), and even a moment of reflection upon the story resonates with a message about the Supreme Power of Allah.</description>

&amp;#8230;عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَنِ  In ayah 64, He describes these &amp;#8220;slaves&amp;#8221; by saying:
َالَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَبِّهِمْ سُجَّداً وَقِيَاماً …  This is translated as: those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrating (in sujood) and standing.

Throughout the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) draws parables for us to convey the importance of certain topics, to extract lessons from them and so that we may ponder and reflect over them. We hear many times of the examples of the hypocrites, the mushrikeen (pagans) and the believers. But there is one parable that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) puts forth that increases the love and mercy between a husband and wife, and this parable is one of the most eloquent and striking in the Qur&amp;#8217;an.</description>

[Suratul Baqarah, verse 112]
1. Submit to Allah = fulfill the faraidh and abandon the haram
2. Be a Muhsin = do ibadah as if you see Allah, treat parents outstandingly, fulfill the rights of others outstandingly…basically, do good at every opportunity and whatever you do, try to be outstanding in it.</description>

      <description>ٱلۡقَهَّارُ &amp;#8211; Al Qahhar  The root word for ٱلۡقَهَّارُ is قَهر which is defined as:
 to compel something or someone against his/her wishes to subdue to overcome to force [1]  Thus, with regards to Allah (سبحانه وتعال), the noble name Al-Qahhar can be translated as &amp;#8220;the Subduer, i.e. the Subduer of His creatures by His sovereign authority and power and the Disposer of them as He pleases, with and against their will.</description>

وَامْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ
فِي جِيدِهَا حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ  Translation: And his wife, the wood-carrier. Upon her neck is a twisted rope of Masad (palm fibre).
Abu Lahab and his wife were some of the most severe opponents to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). They fully understood his message and recognized him as a Prophet, and still they opposed him, until the end of their days.</description>

      <description>Touched by an Angel  Touched by an Angel: Tafseer Juz &amp;#8216;Amma is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Muhammad Alshareef.
Most Muslims learn the Qur&amp;#8217;an starting with Juz &amp;#8216;Amma&amp;#8211;the shortest chapters of the Qur&amp;#8217;an. But, most of us also have no idea what these verses we recite&amp;#8211;day after day, and prayer after prayer, for many of us&amp;#8211;actually mean, and what lessons they impart.
Touched by an Angel: Tafeer Juz &amp;#8216;Amma cures that, by giving Muslims what each and every one of us desires: understanding of the Qur&amp;#8217;an.</description>

      <title>Kaana as Emphasis</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/kaana-as-emphasis/</guid>
      <description>The word kaana is the past-tense masculine singular third-person (he) form of the verb to-be. So you can translate it as &amp;#8220;he was&amp;#8221;. (And the khabr takes the same rules as with any other verb.)
So what does it mean when Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) uses kaana to describe Himself? For example, in surah Nisaa, He says:
إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً  Translation: And seek the Forgiveness of Allah; surely, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful [Surah Nisaa, 4:106]</description>

فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً
إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً  Translation: So verily, with the hardship, there is relief; Verily, with the hardship, there is relief! [Surah Ash-Shrah, verses 5-6]
Two for the price of one! How&amp;#8217;s that for a deal?
So if you find yourself in a position of hardship, ask yourself: What ease am I forgetting?
And also, the use of with, shows that the two are so closely related as to be companions&amp;#8211;they are together!</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/adjectives-for-allah/</guid>
      <description>Allah says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
الْحَمْدُ للّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ الرَّحْمـنِ الرَّحِيمِ
مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ  You might ask, why do rabb, Ar-Rahmaan, Ar-Raheem, and Maalik all have kasra on them? Why not dumma (the default), or fatha?
The answer is that, wallahu &amp;#8216;alim, they are na&amp;#8217;at (adjactives) for Allah&amp;#8211;words that describe His greatness.
For example, Ar-Rahmaan means &amp;#8220;the source of mercy&amp;#8221; (that&amp;#8217;s why, scholars say, you cannot name your son Rahman).</description>

To start,-
 Alhamdulillah for the fact that Allah gave us the ability to thank and praise Him, yet we could never thank Him enough for what He gave us.</description>

&amp;#8220;What makes you think they are all losers?&amp;#8221; questioned Ayesha.
&amp;#8220;Well, look at all the things they are indulged in? They&amp;#8217;re obviously losers,&amp;#8221; I responded, as we both noticed other people carrying on with their activities disapprovingly.</description>

      <description>There are many times throughout our daily activities that we do things without clarifying the intention to ourselves. We may buy a new car but end up doing it to raise our status in society or for pride. At the same time though, we may buy a car and do it solely for Allah&amp;#8217;s cause, and in this there is good. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
&amp;#8220;So whomsoever does good equal to the wieght of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it.</description>

      <description>Inshallah what follows is a small gem from the Qur&amp;#8217;an about Maryam (عليها سلام), mother of &amp;#8216;Isa (عليه سلام).
At the end of Surah Tahrim, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
وَمَرْيَمَ ابْنَتَ عِمْرَانَ الَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِنَا وَصَدَّقَتْ بِكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّهَا وَكُتُبِهِ وَكَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتِينَ  Translation: And Mary the daughter of &amp;#8216;Imran, who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into (her body) of Our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord and of His Revelations, and was one of the Qanitiyn [Surah Tahrim, 66:12]</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/emphasis-in-the-quran/</guid>
      <description>Why is emphasis important? It proves truthfulness. For example, if you says &amp;#8220;Khalid stopped by today&amp;#8221; and your friend says &amp;#8220;Khalid didn&amp;#8217;t stop by today,&amp;#8221; and you say &amp;#8220;I swear by Allah that he stopped by today,&amp;#8221; that proves your truthfulness.
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) doesn&amp;#8217;t need any emphasis&amp;#8211;what He says is always true! Yet He still emphasizes. Whenever He emphasizes something, pay close attention, and realize that what He says immediately afterward is very important.</description>

      <description>Abdullah ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) was a great companion and a great scholar. In fact, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) made du&amp;#8217;a for him, that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grants him knowledge of the deen.
Even more amazing then this, Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) once made du&amp;#8217;a and said, &amp;#8220;O Allah! teach him wisdom (i.e. the understanding of the knowledge of Qur&amp;#8217;an).&amp;#8221; [Bukhari 5/57/100] This is why his tafseer carries a heavy weight, even today, more then a millenium after his death.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/fire-exits-in-the-quran/</guid>
      <description>Whenever Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) mentions the Fire, He (سبحانه وتعالى) always mentions a fire exit&amp;#8211;usually immediately afterwards. There&amp;#8217;s always a chance to escape. But once you die, there&amp;#8217;s no fire exit. For example, in Surah Baqarah, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ  وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِين آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَار  Translation: But if you cannot&amp;#8211;and you can never do it&amp;#8211;then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and the stones, prepared for the Unbelievers.</description>

From this verse, scholars mention that we identify three levels of practice.
First, there are those who don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8211;they don&amp;#8217;t know about Islam. They don&amp;#8217;t know about the truth. Or they don&amp;#8217;t know enough&amp;#8211;for example, how to pay zakaah. These are the ones mentioned as gone astray (الضَّالِّينَ).</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/shirk-the-destroyer/</guid>
      <description>Most of the ayat in the Qur&amp;#8217;an that are directed to non-Muslims, are directed to mushrikeen&amp;#8211;those who commit shirk. In fact, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) spells out, in painful detail, just how dangerous shirk is. Read and remember.
The Unforgivable Sin  Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, in Surah Nisaa:
إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا  Translation: Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.</description>

      <description>In many places in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) makes this statement:
لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُون  Transliteration: Laa khawfun `alayhim wa laa hum yahzanuwn
Translation: No fear upon them and they will not grieve.
You can locate this in many ayat of the Quran, such as: Surah Baqarah verse 38, Surah al-An&amp;#8217;aam verse 48, and Surah Yunus verse 62, and others.
We&amp;#8217;ll break this statement into two parts inshaAllah: the first part, it deals with fear (laa khawfun `alayhim), and the second deals with grief (wa laa hum yuhzinuwn).</description>

أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ اللّهُ مَثَلاً كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاء  Translation: Have you not seen how Allah has given the parable of a beautiful kalimah, like a beautiful tree, whose roots are firmly established, and whose branches tower in the sky?

      <description>Tabaarak (تَبَارَك) has many meanings. The root word (ba-ra-kaf; like barakah) means:
 To Remain/Linger. This is why a pool of water is called birkah in Arabic. Same word. To Nurture/Generate. Connotations are that it increases.  Under Shari&amp;#8217;ah, the divine law of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), tabaarak means: the presence of divine blessings in an object, and an increase of those blessings.

      <description>19) Ease and Light Crossing the Sirat  Towards the end of Judgement Day&amp;#8211;a day that will last 50 000 years (Surah Al-Maarij, verse 4)1, after the judgement has been decreed, the people will have to cross the Sirat&amp;#8211;a bridge sharper then a sword and thinner then a hair2, that runs over Hell&amp;#8211;in order to get to Jannah. People will fall off&amp;#8211;there will be hooks like thorns of a size known only to Allah, to snag people into the Fire.</description>

      <title>Three Aspects of Tawhid</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/three-aspects-of-tawhid/</guid>
      <description>Scholars of &amp;#8216;aqeeda divide tawhid into three aspects: tawhid ar-rububiyyah, tawhid al-uloohiyyah, and tawhid al-asmaa wal sifat.
Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah is the tawhid of Lordship. It pertains to Allah&amp;#8217;s right as the Lord, and all that entails&amp;#8211;the Creator, the Sustainer.
Tawhid Al-Uloohiyyah is the tawheed of worship. It pertains to Allah&amp;#8217;s right to be worshipped, without any partners.
Tawhid Al-Asmaa wal Sifat is the tawheed of Allah&amp;#8217;s names and attributes&amp;#8211;such as that he is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim.</description>

      <description>Allah blessed me with the opportunity to listen to Shaykh Yasir Qadhi, who specializes in Aqeeda, speak about shirk. Here&amp;#8217;s what he said.
Question: What happens if you&amp;#8217;re Muslim and you&amp;#8217;ve committed shirk?
Answerer: Shaykh Yasir Qadhi
In the Qur&amp;#8217;an, in many places, Allah says shirk is unforgivable.
إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا  Translation: Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he devises indeed a great sin.</description>

وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَاء فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَاء حَتَّىَ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتَّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيًّا وَلاَ نَصِيرًا  Translation: They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike; therefore take not from among them friends until they forsake (their homes) in Allah&amp;#8217;s way; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper (Surah Nisaa, 4:89)1</description>

Do you wish to guide him whom Allah has caused to err? And whomsoever Allah causes to err, you shall by no means find a way for him.</description>

Allah takes careful account of all things (Surah Nisaa, 4:86)1
If your brother or sister in Islam gives you salaams, return it. So respond to &amp;#8220;as-salaamu &amp;#8216;alikum&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;wa&amp;#8217;alikum as-salaam wa rahmatullah&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;as-salaamu &amp;#8216;alikum wa rahmatullah&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;wa&amp;#8217;alikum as-salaam wa rahmatullah wa barakatuh&amp;#8221; (but don&amp;#8217;t go beyond that).</description>

It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment (Surah Nisaa, 4:84)1</description>

يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ خُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ فَانفِرُواْ ثُبَاتٍ أَوِ انفِرُواْ جَمِيعًا  Translation: O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together (Surah Nisaa, 4:71).1
The message: prepare, and fight in groups.
A related incident: after the battle of Uhud, many tribes targeted the Muslims to take them down once and for all. The day the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) returned from battle, he slept, prayed &amp;#8216;Isha (alone), and the next day, after Fajr, said &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re going after [the fleeing army].</description>

      <description>The people came to the king and said &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t you see, by Allah, your fear brought about the very thing you were afraid of.&amp;#8221;
The king didn&amp;#8217;t know what to do. So he had ditches dug at all the roads out of the city. People try to escape, BOOM into a ditch. He had people brought to the ditches and said &amp;#8220;disbelieve and live or believe and in you go.&amp;#8221; They believed, so he threw them in.</description>

The king said &amp;#8220;Ok, what do I do?&amp;#8221; Notice the reversal of roles&amp;#8211;who&amp;#8217;s in control now?
So the boy said &amp;#8220;gather the people, cruficy me on a tree trunk, put your arrow in the middle of the bow, say &amp;#8216;in the name of Allah, Lord of the worlds&amp;#8217; and fire.&amp;#8221; And the king did just that, so obsessed to kill the boy he didn&amp;#8217;t realize what the effect would be.</description>

      <description>The king asked the boy to renounce his religion, to which the boy refused. The king said &amp;#8220;take him to the highest mountain and if he doesn&amp;#8217;t renounce by the time you reach the top, throw him off.&amp;#8221;
Why not saw him in half? Because the boy&amp;#8217;s useful. He has influence among the poeple. People love him, and if he joins the king, many will follow his example.
So they took him up, and the boy said &amp;#8220;O Allah, suffice me against them in whatever way You please&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>We often make empty du&amp;#8217;as&amp;#8211;they lack in sincerity, but hey, we don&amp;#8217;t expect them to be answered. But why do it? Are you just testing Allah?
Think with certiny that Allah will answer your du&amp;#8217;a. Make the most sincere, heart-felt du&amp;#8217;a of your existance. And have hope that Allah will answer it. Before Islam, there was a man named Jurayj, a worshipper of Allah. The people around him had intense jealousy of him for this.</description>

      <title>The People of the Ditch (11): Torture and Flattery</title>

      <description>The king&amp;#8217;s companion pointed out the boy.
Why didn&amp;#8217;t he remain silent? For that matter, why does the boy point out the monk later?
Resolve. Ibn Tamiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said &amp;#8220;much of your resolve disappears when tortured&amp;#8221;. Your determination and strength of will plummets. So the man pointing out the boy, well, his determination couldn&amp;#8217;t withstand the torture.
So the king&amp;#8217;s soldiers brought the boy to the king, who said &amp;#8220;O my boy, your magic heals the blind and cures the lepers &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; Then he used flattery.</description>

      <description>The king&amp;#8217;s companion returned to the king. They knew he was cured&amp;#8211;previously, people had to help him find his way in, but now, he waltzed right in.
The king said: &amp;#8220;Who gave you back your sight?&amp;#8221;
His companion said: &amp;#8220;My Lord.&amp;#8221;
The king said: &amp;#8220;Do you have a Lord other then me?&amp;#8221;
His companion said: &amp;#8220;My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&amp;#8221;
So the king tortured him until he pointed out the boy.</description>

      <title>The People of the Ditch (9): Honouring vs. Prophetic Miracles</title>

      <description>The boy healed the blind and the lepers&amp;#8211;the same miracles given to the prophet &amp;#8216;Isa (Jesus), on whom be peace.
Was he a prophet?
No, he was not.
The difference is: Allah gave the boy karamah, a less intense form of mu&amp;#8217;jizah. In a way, karamah mimics mu&amp;#8217;jizah, but to a less intense level.
The boy&amp;#8217;s powers mimiced the miracles of &amp;#8216;Isa (alayhi salaam), to a lesser level. And while &amp;#8216;Isa (alayhi salaam) could resurrect the dead, the boy could not.</description>

      <description>The boy used to heal the blind and the lepers and the people. (He wasn&amp;#8217;t a prophet: see the next post for more details.) The king&amp;#8217;s blind companion (jalees bin malik, or the one who sits next to the king) went to the boy with gifts, and said &amp;#8220;these are all for you if you heal me&amp;#8221;. The boy said &amp;#8220;Truly Allah heals. If you believe in Him, I will pray to Him, and He will heal you.</description>

      <description>Tafseer by the Sunnah of the Prophet of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, has multiple purposes.
 Explains: It explains vague commands such as Hajj, and clarifies details. It also explains unclear concepts, such as the &amp;#8220;white thread of dawn [seperated from] the black thread of night&amp;#8221;. Connotations: Example forthcoming inshaAllah. Clarifies: With commands like &amp;#8220;amputate the hand of the theif&amp;#8221;, it clarifies (they must steal something worth 25 dinar or more, the item must be properly guarded, it cannot be food, etc.</description>

What excellent companions these are that one may get! [Surah An-Nisaa, verse 69]
Prophets are those Allah blessed with divine revelation.</description>

Translation: [&amp;#8230;] Fear the fire whose fuel is people and stones (Surah Baqara: 2:24)
Why stones, you ask? Because idols are made of stones. Subhanallah. People and stones will fuel the Hellfire, the way gasoline fuels cars. May Allah protect us all from that horrid end, ameen.

      <description>Musaylimah used to pray three times a day. He used to lie and say Qur&amp;#8217;an was revealed to him, and he&amp;#8217;d make up verses of &amp;#8220;Qur&amp;#8217;an&amp;#8221;. In one instance, the people came to him and asked &amp;#8220;was anything revealed?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Not yet.&amp;#8221; And later, &amp;#8220;anything yet?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Nope.&amp;#8221;.

At one point, some people came to him and one said &amp;#8220;was anything revealed to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)?</description>

وَإِذَا لَقُواْ الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُواْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَى شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا مَعَكْمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِؤُونَ  Translation: &amp;#8220;When they meet those who believe, they say &amp;#8216;we believe,&amp;#8217; but when they are alone with their shayateen, they say &amp;#8216;we are with you&amp;#8216; &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; (Al-Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:14)1
Although the hypocrites say they believe, they associate their identities with shayateen (devils, or &amp;#8220;evil ones&amp;#8221;).
The lesson: your belief system shapes your identity.</description>

Allah tests people according to the strength of their faith. As you increase in iman, your tests become tougher and tougher. Allah tests everyone, even non-believers. So if you&amp;#8217;re going to be tested, be tested for fleeing to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and the truth.</description>

      <description>The scholar/monk said to the boy, after he defeated the beast: verily, you will be tested.
The sunnah of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is to test those who come with the truth &amp;#8211;place tests in their path. When the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) first received revelation and visited Waraqa, he said: I wish I had the life/strength to live until the time when your people kick you out.

The boy meets the scholar and informs him of what occurred. The scholar replied with: &amp;#8220;O my boy, today you are better then me. You will be tested, so when it happens, do not reveal me (don&amp;#8217;t rat me out).&amp;#8221;

      <description>The lie of the scholar/monk to the boy falls under the three types of acceptable lies, a situation of war.
A beast blocked the path of the people. The boy said: &amp;#8220;O Allah, if the monk is dearer to you, then kill the beast.&amp;#8221; He threw the stone, hit the beast, and it died. (The people came to celebrate him as a great hero.)

      <description>During the time of these people, they had a king who claimed he was Allah&amp;#8211;similar to how Fir&amp;#8217;aun, in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, claims to be Allah.
There is no oppresser that maintains his power without magic. Even today? you might ask.
Even today.
In the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
قَالَ أَلْقُوْاْ فَلَمَّا أَلْقَوْاْ سَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَاءوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ  Translation: Moses said &amp;#8220;Throw ye (first).&amp;#8221; So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic (Surah Al-Araf, 7:116).</description>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:

وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ
قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ
النَّارِ ذَاتِ الْوَقُودِ
إِذْ هُمْ عَلَيْهَا قُعُودٌ
وَهُمْ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ شُهُودٌ
وَمَا نَقَمُوا مِنْهُمْ إِلَّا أَن يُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ  Translation: By the promised Day (of Judgment), by one that witnesses, and the subject of the witness: woe to the makers of the pit (of fire), fire supplied (abundantly) with fuel.</description>
