      <description>Islam as a religion brings an answer to every single question that exists; this is why it is considered as the complete code of life. You can find the impressions of Islam in each part of a Muslim life, regardless of whether it is some financial issue, social, personal or any other thing related to life.
Among the different variables, something which makes Islam the top religion in the case of the contemporary existence of today&amp;#8217;s reality is the way that it is in total reverberation with the modern science that is a primitive instrument for the general population nowadays to judge anything.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Nazi’at, Part 2</title>

      <description>This is post #43 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Continuing into our foray of tafseer of Surah An-Nazi&amp;#8217;aat, we reach the story of Musa (alayhi salaam). Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰ
 Translation: Has there reached you the story of Moses? [Surah Naazi&amp;#8217;aat, verse 15]
One of the interesting aspects of Qur&amp;#8217;an you don&amp;#8217;t get from the translation is discourse.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Nazi’at, Part 1</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2011/tafseer-surah-naziat-part-1/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This is post #42 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, insha&amp;#8217;Allah we will take a whirlwind tour of the first third or so of Surah Naazi&amp;#8217;aat, a great and powerful surah of the Qur&amp;#8217;an. Then insha&amp;#8217;Allah we will go back and dive into more details (particularly in the Arabic side of things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّازِعَاتِ غَرْقًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّاشِطَاتِ نَشْطًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالسَّابِحَاتِ سَبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالسَّابِقَاتِ سَبْقًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُدَبِّرَاتِ أَمْرًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By those [angels] who extract with violence, and [by] those who remove with ease, and [by] those who glide [as if] swimming, and those who race each other in a race, and those who arrange [each] matter, &amp;#8230; [Surah Nazi&amp;#8217;at, verses 1-5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ayaat describe attributes of angels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripping Out:&lt;/strong&gt; Gharq (غَرْق) means to rip out, to yank out, to extract harshly. If you had a tree and you uprooted it, roots and all, that would be gharq. This refers to the angels who remove the souls of the corrupt and the evil-doers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gently Pulling:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse two contrasts verse one by mentioning nasht (نَشْط), which is like a gentle pulling. This refers to the angels that remove the souls of the righteous believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swimming:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse three refers to angels who &lt;em&gt;swim through the air&lt;/em&gt;; they are described as swimming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racing:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse four refers to angels who are racing; racing the souls of the righteous to Jannah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al-Mudabiraat:&lt;/strong&gt; Al-Mudabiraat are those angelswho settle the affairs of deen and dunya, in the dunya. They take care of floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters, among other things. Their name, al-mudabiraat, also implies that they are thorough planners and executers of those plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are &lt;em&gt;aqsaam&lt;/em&gt; (oaths), which is typical in Mecci surahs. What is Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) swearing to?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This is post #41 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In the previous two posts, we discussed the first three quarters of this juz; now, we move into the final quarter. After describing some of the punishments of Hellfire, Allah says:
 إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا
حَدَائِقَ وَأَعْنَابًا
وَكَوَاعِبَ أَتْرَابًا
وَكَأْسًا دِهَاقً
لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا كِذَّابًا
 Translation: Indeed, for the righteous is attainment/success &amp;#8211; gardens and grapevines, and full-breasted [companions] of equal age, and a full cup.</description>

      <description>This is post #40 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In the previous post, we discussed the first 16 verses of Surah Naba&amp;#8217;. The remaining 24 verses discuss the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire; you should read them to extract the details. Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;re going to touch on a few points that are interesting.
First, a recap&amp;#8211;verse 16 talked about (a continuing discussion of) some of the blessings of Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) in the dunya on the people.</description>

      <description>This is post #39 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
The tafseer of Surah Naba&amp;#8217; really speaks for itself; it talks about the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire&amp;#8211;three strong, recurring themes in the last juz. And this is, of course, the first surah in Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Therefore, we&amp;#8217;re going to focus mostly on the linguistic meaning of the words in the verses, and some gleams of tafseer you might not extract from just reading the verses in Arabic.</description>

Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says in Surah Al-Ghaashiyah:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ
 Translation: Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming [event]? [Surah Ghashiya, verse 1]
The surah starts with a question, to make you think. The companions would say: Allahu wa rasuluhu a&amp;#8217;lam (know better), out of humbleness, even know they had an answer in mind.</description>

      <description>The following is a guest post from I Got it Covered, a blog about hijab, Islam, and life. You can find the original article here.
In the time of &amp;#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab, radiAllahu anhu, the second Khalifah, it was mandatory upon all the young girls to learn Surat an-Noor.
From the beauty of this Surah is that it begins with, &amp;#8220;[This is] a surah which We have sent down and made [that within it] obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember&amp;#8221; [Surat an-Noor: 1].</description>

      <description>This is post #37 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Allah says, in Surah Tariq:
 وَالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ
وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ
النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ
 Translation: By the sky and the night comer (At-Tariq), And what can make you know what is the night comer? It is the piercing star. [Surah At-Taariq, verses 1-3]
As we mentioned before, one of the characteristics of early and Mecci surahs, like this one, is that they begin with a qasam &amp;#8212; an oath, a testification.</description>

Allah subhaanhu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an (the meaning of which is):
 &amp;#8220;(It was said to his son): &amp;#8220;O Yahya (John)! Hold fast the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)].&amp;#8221; And We gave him wisdom while yet a child. And (made him) sympathetic to men as a mercy (or a grant) from Us, and pure from sins [i.e. Yahya (John)] and he was righteous, and dutiful towards his parents, and he was neither an arrogant nor disobedient (to Allah or to his parents).</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Humazah: The Crusher</title>

      <description>This is post #36 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In Surah Humazah, Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ
 Translation: Woe to every scorner (humazah) and mocker (lumazah). [Surah Al-Humaza, verse 1].
As we mentioned many, many times before in this series, wayl is a curse. And when Allah says wayl about someone, it&amp;#8217;s not a curse, but a statement of reality&amp;#8211;because He, &amp;#8216;azza wa jal, is not in need of cursing anyone.</description>

In this post, we will insha&amp;#8217;Allah do a word-for-word breakdown of each surah, as space permits.
In the first ayah, Allah (subhannahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala) says:
 لَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَٰذَا الْبَلَدِ
 The first two words, laa uqsimu (لَا أُقْسِمُ) literally means &amp;#8220;I do not swear.&amp;#8221; Uqsimu is mudaari&amp;#8217; mutakallim waahid, i.</description>

The CN Tower, 150 stories high. Fa laa iqtahamaa al-aqabah.  Continuing our discussion of Surah Balad, Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ
وَلِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ
وَهَدَيْنَاهُ النَّجْدَيْنِ

Allah says:
 لَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَذَا الْبَلَدِ
 Translation: I swear by this city (Makkah) &amp;#8230; [Surah Balad, verse 1]
&amp;#8220;Laa uqsim&amp;#8221; literally means, &amp;#8220;I will not swear by.&amp;#8221; in Arabic language, it means &amp;#8220;this thing is so truthful, I almost don&amp;#8217;t even have to swear by it.</description>

This post is chronologically out of order, since Surah Quraish was revealed before surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah; but insha&amp;#8217;Allah khayr. Allah says:
 لِإِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ
إِيلَافِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَاءِ وَالصَّيْفِ
فَلْيَعْبُدُوا رَبَّ هَذَا الْبَيْتِ
الَّذِي أَطْعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٍ وَآمَنَهُم مِّنْ خَوْفٍ
 Translation: For the accustomed security of the Quraysh &amp;#8211; Their accustomed security [in] the caravan of winter and summer &amp;#8211; Let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.</description>

As per the poll on our twitter account, there was consensus on their being a post on grammatical analysis of Surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah. So here you go insha&amp;#8217;Allah.
Standard Disclaimer: I am not an Arab (as in, fluent in Arabic) nor have I double-checked this in books of &amp;#8216;ulama discussing grammar; there is sometimes difference of opinion in grammar, as well; so take it as such insha&amp;#8217;Allah.</description>

 Translation: The Striking Calamity &amp;#8211; What is the Striking Calamity? And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity? [Surah Qaariah, verses 1-3]
As we mentioned, the phrase in verse three&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;wa maa adaraaka maa &amp;#8230;,&amp;#8221; is a phrase that means that, you cannot understand this thing&amp;#8211;Al-Qaari&amp;#8217;ah, the striking calamity.</description>

Calligraphy of Arabic, or maybe Al-Qur&amp;#8217;an, inscribed in metal!  Continuing our discussion of Surah At-Teen, we&amp;#8217;re going to insha&amp;#8217;Allah dive into the Arabic analysis.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is post #27 in our series on Tafseer of Juz ‘Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Al-Burooj:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالسَّمَاءِ ذَاتِ الْبُرُوجِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالْيَوْمِ الْمَوْعُودِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the sky containing great stars. And [by] the promised Day. And [by] the witness and what is witnessed. Cursed were the companions of the trench. [Surah Al-Buruj, verses 1-4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Ashaab-ul-Burooj, the People of the Ditch, is pretty well-known; in fact, we have an &lt;a href=&#34;the-people-of-the-ditch&#34;&gt;entire 15-part series&lt;/a&gt; on this surah. Check it out insha&amp;#8217;Allah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah opens this surahs with testifications. Then he testifies: qutila ashaabul-&amp;#8216;uqdood. &amp;#8216;uqdood is another word for ditch. Qutila, literally, means &amp;#8220;they were killed.&amp;#8221; But Ibn Abbaas (radiallahu anhu) said, whenever you read qutila in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, it means lu&amp;#8217;ina&amp;#8211;cursed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allah cursed the People of the Ditch.&lt;/strong&gt; And Allah is not in need of cursing&amp;#8211;He can do anything, to anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lu&amp;#8217;ina means, they were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they _are_destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what great sin did they perpetrate in order to deserve this immense reward&amp;#8211;not only being cursed and destroyed, but &lt;em&gt;being documented in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, to be recited until the end of time&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

The noble she-camel, prized in the Arab society, was actually one of the signs Allah sent to a nation. What did they do with it?  Surahs are usually named by something unique in their content. But the sun (ash-shams) is mentioned in several surahs; so why is this one called Surah Shams?</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Qadar: What’s Better Than 1000 Months?</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-surah-qadar-whats-better-than-1000-months/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is post #25 in our series on Tafseer of Juz ‘Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reason-of-revelation&#34;&gt;Reason of Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) told the companions about a man of the previous nations; a man who lived and fought jihad for over 1000 months (roughly 83 years, 4 months). (In case you didn&amp;#8217;t know, the previous nations lived longer than us&amp;#8211;like Prophet Nuh (alayhi salaam), who did da&amp;#8217;wah for nearly 1000 years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companions were amazed, and they said: how can we compete with him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And subhanallah, this is a gem. &lt;em&gt;Look at the companions.&lt;/em&gt; They &lt;strong&gt;prioritized and competed for the akhirah.&lt;/strong&gt; Subhanallah to the point that, they don&amp;#8217;t just try to do &amp;#8220;some good deeds before I die;&amp;#8221; not enough. They competed with each other&amp;#8211;but even that was not enough. Rather, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;they competed with all of the Muslims, ever, starting from the time of Prophet Adam, until the Day of Judgment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to really look at ourselves and see, how much are we like them? Or are we just vying for bigger houses, better cars&amp;#8211;more dunya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s not dunya status that matters. Allah teaches us this again in Surah Abasa&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s the one with taqwa.

&lt;p&gt;How would you feel if someone you love corrected you, in public, in front of everyone else? Would you feel condemned, or criticized? Would you take it more seriously than someone you don&amp;#8217;t like criticizing you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if &lt;strong&gt;Allah, the Lord of the Universe,&lt;/strong&gt; criticized you &amp;#8230; in public?&lt;/p&gt;

Allah says, in Surah Tawheed, also known as Surah Ikhlas:
 قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ
لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ
وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ
 Translation: Say, &amp;#8220;He is Allah , [who is] One, Allah , the Eternal Refuge [As-Samad], He neither begets (gives birth to) nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.</description>

      <title>3 Shields of Protection From Supernatural Forces</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/forest-night-light.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; title=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1233&#34; /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;The protection of Allah is easily earned and very, very powerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims love talking about Jinns and black magic. Yet, when it comes to inoculating themselves from supernatural forces, Muslims are often either ignorantly doing &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of what they need to do, or proverbially standing on the interstate highway, woefully oblivious of thousands of cars speeding by at near-miss distances. And many of us, or people we know, personally &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even the newest Muslim is often quickly equipped with powerful shields of protection against these forces. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

The Sabab-un-Nuzool (reason of revelation) for Surah Fil well-known; you can read all about it, along with some lessons and gems, in this post by Sr. Mariam 3.36. Please read it, since I won&amp;#8217;t touch on those points.
I will mention, however, two points not mentioned there&amp;#8211;that the Christian tyrant king who brought his elephant, why did he decide to destroy the Ka&amp;#8217;bah?</description>

In Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon, Allah says:
 فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ
الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ
الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ
وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ
 Translation: So woe to those who pray; those who are heedless of their prayer, those who make show [of their deeds]; And withhold [simple] assistance (al-ma&amp;#8217;oon). [Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon, verses 4-7]</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #18 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series). Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;ll be kicking up the post frequency to three times a week in order to finish before Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يُكَذِّبُ بِالدِّينِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَذَلِكَ الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَى طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you seen the one who denies the Repayment? For that is the one who drives away the orphan, and does not encourage the feeding of the poor. [Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon, verses 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the connection here&amp;#8211;verse one, the one who denies Ad-Deen, the Day of Repayment. And verse two and three? He drives away orphans, He doesn&amp;#8217;t encourage feeding of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t feed&lt;/em&gt; the poor. It&amp;#8217;s that he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t encourange&lt;/em&gt; feeding the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graves &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah At-Takaathur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حَتَّى زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graveyards. [Surah At-Takaathur, verses 1-2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subhanallah, even though these verses were revealed over 1400 years ago, we still see the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; situation today. Al-Haakum means, it makes you compete with each other. At-Takaathur is rivalry, competition, in accumulating material things; thinking that life is about toys, and the one with the most (or most expensive) toys wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Takaathur?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/arabic-explanation-of-surah-takweer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #17 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/sun-in-space.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1177&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  When the sun is &lt;em&gt;kuwwirat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to digress a bit and jump back to Surah Takweer. This post is based on Shaykh Nouman Khan&amp;#8217;s tafseer, which heavily emphasizes the Arabic language. I hope you will find, as I found it, as a glimpse of a previously-unseen world, a depth of knowledge that just drips from the Arabic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in surah Takweer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; When the sun is &lt;em&gt;kuwwirat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230; [verse 1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of gems that we learn even from this first ayah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idhaa + Past-Tense:&lt;/strong&gt; Idhaa is an indicator of future-tense &amp;#8220;when (something will happen).&amp;#8221; Yet, kuwwirat is past-tense; why? This combination means &lt;strong&gt;something is so certain, it&amp;#8217;s like past-tense.&lt;/strong&gt; So Allah is saying &amp;#8220;when this happens,&amp;#8221; yet it&amp;#8217;s certain that it WILL happen; as certain as the past is past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominal Sentence:&lt;/strong&gt; The default in Arabic is to put the verb first&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;kuwwirat ash-shamsu.&amp;#8221; To reverse this into &amp;#8220;ash-shamsu kuwwirat,&amp;#8221; shows emphasis, and makes it a tougher, stronger sentence. This hints at the audience&amp;#8211;Mushrikeen in Mecca, the worst and most obstinate of them, who are listening to this revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Voice:&lt;/strong&gt; Allah could have said, &amp;#8220;When I wrap up the sun,&amp;#8221; but He didn&amp;#8217;t. Why? If you&amp;#8217;re biased against someone (say a political party), &lt;em&gt;no matter what they say&lt;/em&gt;, even before they open their mouth, you say, &amp;#8220;psshh.&amp;#8221; But here, passive-voice highlights the maf&amp;#8217;ool, the recipient of the action&amp;#8211;the sun, the stars&amp;#8211;instead of the doer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the meaning of kuwwirat, kawwara means to wrap something around something; it&amp;#8217;s used in the context of a turban, something long, that&amp;#8217;s wrapped around your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah is applying the same meaning here&amp;#8211;that the light of the sun, something that&amp;#8217;s long, will be kuwwirat, wrapped up. Wrapped up meaning, something will cover it, and it will no longer be visible; and it will be wrapped slowly, part by part disappearing&amp;#8211;the same way that Allah described the day as wrapping around the night and the night wrapping around the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something scary&amp;#8211;that you see the sun wrapped up, and losing its light. But &lt;em&gt;there&amp;#8217;s more&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #16 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-in-mountains.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1168&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Indeed, We gave you Al-Kawthar.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Al-Kauthar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice [to Him alone]. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off. [Surah Kawthar, verse 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you know the hadith where the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) was napping under a tree, and he woke up, smiling; and he said, Allah revealed to me this surah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the &amp;#8216;ulama have discussed this&amp;#8211;is it possible that Allah sends revelation in a dream? The answer is, surprisingly, &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;; of the 6-7 ways, the most common is through Jibreel (alayhi salaam). Even here, there&amp;#8217;s no indication that the surah was revealed through a dream&amp;#8211;perhaps Jibreel (alayhi salaam) came to the Prophet once he had woken, and revealed it to him. (For more information, check our posts on Route 114: Uloom Al-Qur&amp;#8217;an)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verse 1, Allah says: Inna &amp;#8216;ataynaaka al-kawthar. These two words allude to an enormous giver, giving an enormous gift. Allah could&amp;#8217;ve just said: ataytuka al-kawthar; but that would&amp;#8217;ve been weak, human speech. Instead, he uses inna&amp;#8211;emphasis, and refers to himself in the &amp;#8220;royal we&amp;#8221; (something we have in English, too).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #15 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/horse-saddle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1159&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah begins Surah Aadiyaat by saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالْعَادِيَاتِ ضَبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُورِيَاتِ قَدْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُغِيرَاتِ صُبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the &amp;#8216;aadiyaat, when they pant, and the muwriyraat striking (when their hoves strike the ground and make sparks), and the mughiyraat, at dawn (when they raid), stirring up thereby [clouds of] dust, arriving thereby in the center collectively, &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a qasam (oath), a big oath that spans five ayaat. I&amp;#8217;m going to dive into word-for-word translation, because no translation can do justice (without paragraphs of brackets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;Aadiyaat (عَادِيَات) are horses (plural: sound feminine plural, in fact). Not those horses you see Canadian Mounties riding; but real, true, WAR horses. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen war-horses (send us a picture!), they have a special, particular intensity to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dabhaa (ضَبْحًا) means to pant. Pant meaning, if you&amp;#8217;ve ever run in a 100-meter race, or tried to run until you&amp;#8217;re tired, and you start breathing heavily through your mouth&amp;#8211;that&amp;#8217;s panting. Why are the &amp;#8216;aadiyaat panting? Because they are &lt;em&gt;charging&lt;/em&gt; into battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll see lots of war concepts here. The Arabs at the time of the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) knew these things very, very well; and when Allah testifies, these things he testifies by&amp;#8211;nobody would deny them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muwriyaat (مُورِيَات) are also war-horses&amp;#8211;the ones that strike. Strike meaning, when they run, their hooves strike up sparks on the ground. I definitely don&amp;#8217;t encourage watching movies, so if you&amp;#8217;ve ever read seerah stories, or perhaps Lord of the Rings, or similar books, you might find these kinds of concepts in their battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mughiyraat (مُغِيرَات) are the raiding horses. In the time of the Prophet, they would have raids; you would see a whole army of horses and riders sweeping into a city, and they&amp;#8217;d kill everybody and destroy it. Mughiyraat are those raiding horses that they rode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Reality of Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 14th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/clock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;85741170&#34; title=&#34;85741170&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1147&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah &amp;#8216;Asr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالْعَصْرِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;By Time. Indeed, mankind is at loss. Except for those who have believed, done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.&amp;#8221; [Asr: 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah swears by time&amp;#8211;which shows how enormous and noble this creation is. Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imam Shafi said about this revelation that had it been the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; revelation sent to mankind, it would have been enough.  What motivated him to say this?&lt;/p&gt;

Stand up and do more. Muslims don&amp;#8217;t retire or quit from working for the deen. Persist. Be like the flower that springs through concrete.
Allah says, in verse 3:
 وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ
 Translation: And raised high for you your repute.

      <title>Tafseer of Surah Duhaa</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-duhaa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2009 18:24:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-duhaa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 12th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/breakfast-on-bed.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1118&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Islam is about social service and shukr (thankfulness).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insha&amp;#8217;Allah in this post, we&amp;#8217;re going to discuss three points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The close relationship between Allah and His prophet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A glimpse of Paradise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A core theme of social services in Islam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) received revelation prior to Surah Duhaa. Then for a while, nothing. Umm Jameelah, the wife of Abu Lahab, came to him and said: &amp;#8220;I hope your shaytaan has finally left you.&amp;#8221; Because the Arabs used to say, if someone was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good at something, that they had a shaytaan helping them. (No doubt like some of the musicians today.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still nothing came. The people began to talk &amp;#8230; and they said, maybe his Lord has left him. Maybe He has abandoned him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Allah revealed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Duhaa, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالضُّحَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By duhaa (the morning brightness after Fajr), and [by] the night when it covers with darkness, your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muúammad], nor has He detested [you].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This hadith is found in Bukhari and Muslim, and is quoted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=93&amp;amp;tid=58628&#34;&gt;Tafseer ibn Katheer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows us two things: first, that the people &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; when revelation came; that it was a big deal, and everybody knew about it. And second, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;the immense love of Allah for His prophet.&lt;/span&gt; How close their relationship&amp;#8211;that even something as small as this stress, Allah revealed verses on behalf of the prophet, to reassure him. Subhanallah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, Allah &lt;em&gt;swears&lt;/em&gt; by duhaa&amp;#8211;by the brightness of the day right after the sun has come up&amp;#8211;and by the night, as it covers up the day with darkness. (This shows the greatness of these creations&amp;#8211;that Allah swears by them. Who would deny these things? Nobody!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;font-size: 80%; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  What have you packed for the Hereafter?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 11th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Fajr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَأَمَّا الْإِنسَانُ إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَأَكْرَمَهُ وَنَعَّمَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَكْرَمَنِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَأَمَّا إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَهَانَنِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, &amp;#8220;My Lord has honored me.&amp;#8221; But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, &amp;#8220;My Lord has humiliated me.&amp;#8221; [Surah Fajr, verses 15-16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice here, Allah is commenting on the mentality of the human race. When Allah gives &amp;#8230; the human being says: &amp;#8220;My Lord has honoured me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#8217;s all about wealth &amp;#8230; money &amp;#8230; dunya. This is the metric we use. You see the president of a country? You&amp;#8217;re very respectful. If the same president was a homeless bum asking you for change? You wouldn&amp;#8217;t even look at him. We equate money with respect and honour &amp;#8230; as Allah points out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the flip side? When Allah constrains the rizq, the human being says: &amp;#8220;My lord has humiliated me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #10 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Layl, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَمَا خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the night when it covers, and [by] the day when it appears, and [by] He who created the male and female: &lt;em&gt;Indeed&lt;/em&gt;, your paths are diverse. [Surah Layl, verses 1-4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arabic (and in English), people talk. And when you want to really draw attention to something, you make an oath. Compare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child 1:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t break the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I swear by my mother&amp;#8217;s grave, that I didn&amp;#8217;t break the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would you pay more attention to? Obviously, the second child (by the way, don&amp;#8217;t swear by other than Allah, it&amp;#8217;s shirk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine two people talking&amp;#8211;your brother or sister, who you&amp;#8217;ve known forever, and the President of America. Who would you pay more attention to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lillahi mathalu al-&amp;#8216;alaa. This is &lt;strong&gt;Allah&lt;/strong&gt; talking to you. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; He&amp;#8217;s making an oath&amp;#8211;not just one, but three things! We should &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; pay attention here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what does He testify to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 4&amp;#8211;that your paths are different.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tafseer of Surah Al-‘Ala</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-al-ala/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:10:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-al-ala/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #9 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/tajmahal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Taj Mahal, a HUGE palace.&#34; title=&#34;The Taj Mahal, a HUGE palace.&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1082&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-&amp;#8216;Ala is one recited quite often; the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to recite it in Witr, and in Jumu&amp;#8217;ah, and in &amp;#8216;Eid; and on days when Jumuah and &amp;#8216;Eid coincide, people would hear it in &amp;#8216;Eid, then again a few hours later in Jumu&amp;#8217;ah. This indicates &lt;strong&gt;the great importance&lt;/strong&gt; of Surah Al-&amp;#8216;Ala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you probably didn&amp;#8217;t know about this surah&amp;#8211;when we say &amp;#8220;Subhanna rabbiy al-&amp;#8216;alaa&amp;#8221; in sujood, that comes from this verse&amp;#8211;because the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded us to do so. This is where it comes from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive into some of the tafseer.  In ayah 9, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #8 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/10123827.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;10123827&#34; title=&#34;10123827&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1070&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue on our journey through tafseer of Juz Amma, we come across Surah Takweer.  Surah Takweer begins with a description of the Day of Judgement.  What we have to keep in mind as we go through the surahs in chronological order is that these first surahs were teachhing big lessons and getting across major points.  In this Surah Allah t&amp;#8217;Ala tells us to think about the bigger picture.  In fact Allah t&amp;#8217;Ala &lt;strong&gt;shows&lt;/strong&gt; us what the Day of Judgement will be like.  All of this to help get our minds to focus on the big picture in life.  And what could be bigger than the  Day of Judgement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive into the verses, to understand them more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us know Surah Lahab. It&amp;#8217;s one of the first one Muslim children learn these days. We&amp;#8217;re going to breeze through the tafseer, then dive into one of the miracles, and finish up with some Arabic analysis.
Allah says:
 تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ
مَا أَغْنَى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ
سَيَصْلَى نَاراً ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ</description>

In verses 9 and 10 of Surah Iqraa, Allah says:
 أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يَنْهَى
عَبْداً إِذَا صَلَّى
 Translation: Have you seen the one who forbids a servant when he prays?
The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to make sujood to Allah in the courtyard of the ka&amp;#8217;bah in early times in Mecca, and nobody would stop him.</description>

In our last post, we talked about how the human race does taghaa if they see themselves as self-sufficient. Living in western societies, we see this all around us&amp;#8211;people racing, fighting, stealing, overworking, to make a few more dollars so that they can &amp;#8220;make it.&amp;#8221; They buy lottery tickets so they can &amp;#8220;make it&amp;#8221; and be rich, rich rich!</description>

      <description>Note: This is our 4th post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Allah says, in ayahs 6-7 of Surah Iqraa:
 كَلَّا إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَيَطْغَى
أَن رَّآهُ اسْتَغْنَى
 Translation: No! [But] indeed, man transgresses. Because he sees himself self-sufficient. [Surah Iqraa, verses 6-7]
Kalla is a very stern, emphatic warning. If your kid is being bad, you say &amp;#8220;laa, laa;&amp;#8221; and then they grab something hot off the stove and you say &amp;#8220;KALLA!</description>

From the opening ceremonies, to the first move of world leaders, people like to send a message. The intense revelation of the Qur’an is no different. The timing, style and content, sends a message to the final Prophet (saw) and to all of humanity.
Allah (swt) starts the revelation commanding the Prophet to read &amp;#8220;Recite in the name of your Lord who created.</description>

      <title>Arabic Analysis for First Revelation</title>

      <description>This is the second post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
The first five ayaat of Surah Iqraa are:
 اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ
خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ
اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الْأَكْرَمُ
الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ
عَلَّمَ الْإِنسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ
 Word-for-word translations are pretty common these days (like this one, which has Surah Iqraa), so I&amp;#8217;m going to touch lightly on that, and do a bit more grammar.</description>

Aqsaam (oaths) in the Qur&amp;#8217;an are a very fascinating subject that we should study and focus on more. There are a few components needed for a qasm (oath) to occur. One of them is the harf qasm, a letter that shows there is an oath being taken.
There are a few letters in the Qur&amp;#8217;an that are used as harf qasm, for example, Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala says &amp;#8220;wal &amp;#8216;aadiyaati dhabhaa&amp;#8221;. The harf qasm in this oath is the letter wow (و).</description>

The two most common names for the Book of Allah are: Qur&amp;#8217;an and Kitaab.
We learn when studying the Qur&amp;#8217;an that even the words chosen are a revelation from Allah with divine wisdom. So, in that case, what do these two names mean and what is the difference between them?
The word &amp;#8216;Qur&amp;#8217;an&amp;#8217; is said to be from two roots, one of them qaaf-ra-hamza, this root qara&amp;#8217;a means to recite.</description>

      <title>NOW is the Time to Learn Arabic!</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2008/now-is-the-time-to-learn-arabic/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2008 16:48:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2008/now-is-the-time-to-learn-arabic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bismillah walhamdulillah, was Salaatu was Salaamu &amp;#8216;alaa Rasoolillaah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;On the Day of Judgment, the Qur&amp;#8217;an and its people who used to act by it in the world shall be brought, being lead by Surat ul-Baqarah and Al-e-Imraan, which shall be arguing on behalf of their &lt;span&gt;companions&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (Reported by Muslim)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all strive to become a companion of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, but who are its true companions? The companions of the Qur&amp;#8217;an are those who studied it, memorized it, implemented it and lived by it. It is not possible, in the least bit, for one to become a companion of the Qur&amp;#8217;an and not know Arabic. Learning the language is the starting point of a life long journey with the Qur&amp;#8217;an. Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala chose this blessed language, as He states 11 times throughout the Qur&amp;#8217;an: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A Book, whereof the verses are explained in detail as an &lt;span&gt;Arabic&lt;/span&gt; Qur&amp;#8217;an, for people who know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (41:3), &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;An &lt;span&gt;Arabic&lt;/span&gt; Qur&amp;#8217;an, without any crookedness, so that they may have Taqwa.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (39:28), &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;We have sent it down as an &lt;span&gt;Arabic&lt;/span&gt; Qur&amp;#8217;an, in order that you may gain understanding.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (12:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know the language of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, they will be deprived of its true sweetness, of its blessings and most importantly, understanding the words of Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala. It is a cause of much grief and sadness to know that the majority of our ummah has lost the connection with the Book of Allah because the language has been lost, as the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam said: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Allah raises up peoples by this Book, and puts down by it others.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (Saheeh Muslim) We have abandoned this book, and the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam will testify to Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala on the day of judgment: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;And the Messenger will say, O my Rabb, indeed my people deserted this Qur&amp;#8217;an!&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (25:30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The righteous companions and scholars of the past have testified to the importance of learning this language and they themselves, who were native Arab speakers, were concerned with studying this language. Umar radi Allahu anhu said, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Learn Arabic for it is a part of your deen&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; (Iqtidaa&amp;#8217; al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;207&lt;/sub&gt;) It is also reported that Ubay ibn Ka&amp;#8217;b radi Allahu anhu said, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Learn Arabic just as you learn to memorize the Qur&amp;#8217;an&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; (Ibn Abî Shaybah, &lt;em&gt;Al-Mu&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;annaf&lt;/em&gt; Vol.7 p150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us want to take the proper steps to learn Arabic, but do not know where to start. What is the solution? Where do we begin? The best option is to study overseas, however many of us do not have that option to learn Arabic, so inshaAllah we&amp;#8217;ll cover in this article some easy steps one can take to begin the process of learning Qur&amp;#8217;anic Arabic if they cannot travel to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

In a few days, the shayateen will be let loose and the difficulties will emerge. Ya Rabbi! Give this ummah the strength to fight the shayateen and keep us steadfast in the deen.</description>

In one of the most beautiful beginnings of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala starts surah Saad with a powerful reminder. He says:
صۚ وَالْقُرْآنِ ذِي الذِّكْرِ
Saad. And by the Qur&amp;#8217;an, full of dhikr! [Surah Saad, verse 1]
This ayah begins with a letter, which are known as: huroof muqatta&amp;#8217;aat, the disjointed letters. There are many opinions as to what these letters mean, but the greatest and strongest opinion is that none but Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala knows their meanings.</description>

Allah ta’ala promises ‘Tooba’ to the believers in this ayah. We also know this word for the famous hadeeth of the strangers, the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam states: fa Tooba lil ghurabaa’, so Tooba to the strangers.</description>

Linguistically, Hamd is from ha-meem-daal ( حمد or ح م د) and it is to mention the good attribute of a person, such an attribute that is the at the level of perfection. Hamd is based on mahabbah (love) and ta&amp;#8217;dheem (greatness).</description>

Why do we only feel this way in these gatherings?
Allah azza wa jal provides the answer:
He says in Surah Ra’d ayah 28:الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوب

[Surah Suratul Anbiya, verse 39]
The word for ward off is &amp;#8220;yakuffoona&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;يَكُفُّونَ&amp;#8221; and this is from the root word &amp;#8220;ka-fa-fa&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;kaff&amp;#8221; which means palm/hand.</description>

      <description>Victory comes only by the decree and permission of Allah, and this is true whether the victory is a small personal victory (like meeting a personal goal), the victory of a nation (like winning a battle), or the victory of passing the tests of dunya (like overcoming temptation and lowering your gaze). The evidence that supports this rule is ample, and the quality of the evidence—subhaanAllah, the stories are amazing! One such story comes from Suratul-Fil (The Elephant), and even a moment of reflection upon the story resonates with a message about the Supreme Power of Allah.</description>

&amp;#8230;عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَنِ  In ayah 64, He describes these &amp;#8220;slaves&amp;#8221; by saying:
َالَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَبِّهِمْ سُجَّداً وَقِيَاماً …  This is translated as: those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrating (in sujood) and standing.

      <description>Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ood (رضي الله عنه‏) is one of the most well-known companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). (Can someone suggest some good links that detail his biography?) Orientalists&amp;#8211;who do not generally fabricate&amp;#8211;claim that, prior to the Second Compilation, Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ood&amp;#8217;s (رضي الله عنه‏) mushaf had two extra surahs that our mushafs today don&amp;#8217;t have. If you investigate this claim, you find that, indeed, it&amp;#8217;s authentically report that his mushaf had two extra chapters.</description>

      <description>The Qur&amp;#8217;an was first compiled during the lifetime of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (رضي الله عنه‏), the first khalifa, whose rule lasted from the death of the last messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for two years.
Why wasn&amp;#8217;t it compiled during the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself?
 On-Going Revelation: Revelation was still coming down. If you wrote two verses next to each other, and Allah revealed one in the middle&amp;#8211;or an extension to the end of a surah&amp;#8211;what then?</description>

      <description>Qira&amp;#8217;aat. Recitations. Like other parts of Islam, Qira&amp;#8217;aat have been codified&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s a science, just like the science of hadith.
And, just like ahadith, qira&amp;#8217;aat have different types. What kind of types? Four types, actually:
 Saheeh: Authentic qira&amp;#8217;aat. To be saheeh, a qira&amp;#8217;ah must have an authentic chain of narration back to the Prophet (S), and it must conform with the Uthmanic mushaf. There are ten of these puppies&amp;#8211;not seven, as is the common misconception.</description>

      <description>So what exactly is the Qur&amp;#8217;an?
Scholars define the Qur&amp;#8217;an as this: The Arabic speech of Allah that was revealed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) both in word and in meaning. It is collected between the two covers of the mushaaf, was narrated in mutawaatir chains, and is a challenge to humankind.
We can learn five important things about the Qur&amp;#8217;an from this definition.
 The Arabic speech of Allah: The Qur&amp;#8217;an is the speech of Allah, in Arabic.</description>
