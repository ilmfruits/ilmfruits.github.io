      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bismillah walhamdulillah, was Salaatu was Salaamu &amp;#8216;alaa Rasoolillaah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;On the Day of Judgment, the Qur&amp;#8217;an and its people who used to act by it in the world shall be brought, being lead by Surat ul-Baqarah and Al-e-Imraan, which shall be arguing on behalf of their &lt;span&gt;companions&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (Reported by Muslim)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all strive to become a companion of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, but who are its true companions? The companions of the Qur&amp;#8217;an are those who studied it, memorized it, implemented it and lived by it. It is not possible, in the least bit, for one to become a companion of the Qur&amp;#8217;an and not know Arabic. Learning the language is the starting point of a life long journey with the Qur&amp;#8217;an. Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala chose this blessed language, as He states 11 times throughout the Qur&amp;#8217;an: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A Book, whereof the verses are explained in detail as an &lt;span&gt;Arabic&lt;/span&gt; Qur&amp;#8217;an, for people who know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (41:3), &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;An &lt;span&gt;Arabic&lt;/span&gt; Qur&amp;#8217;an, without any crookedness, so that they may have Taqwa.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (39:28), &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;We have sent it down as an &lt;span&gt;Arabic&lt;/span&gt; Qur&amp;#8217;an, in order that you may gain understanding.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (12:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know the language of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, they will be deprived of its true sweetness, of its blessings and most importantly, understanding the words of Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala. It is a cause of much grief and sadness to know that the majority of our ummah has lost the connection with the Book of Allah because the language has been lost, as the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam said: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Allah raises up peoples by this Book, and puts down by it others.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (Saheeh Muslim) We have abandoned this book, and the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam will testify to Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala on the day of judgment: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;And the Messenger will say, O my Rabb, indeed my people deserted this Qur&amp;#8217;an!&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (25:30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The righteous companions and scholars of the past have testified to the importance of learning this language and they themselves, who were native Arab speakers, were concerned with studying this language. Umar radi Allahu anhu said, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Learn Arabic for it is a part of your deen&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; (Iqtidaa&amp;#8217; al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;207&lt;/sub&gt;) It is also reported that Ubay ibn Ka&amp;#8217;b radi Allahu anhu said, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Learn Arabic just as you learn to memorize the Qur&amp;#8217;an&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; (Ibn Ab√Æ Shaybah, &lt;em&gt;Al-Mu&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;annaf&lt;/em&gt; Vol.7 p150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us want to take the proper steps to learn Arabic, but do not know where to start. What is the solution? Where do we begin? The best option is to study overseas, however many of us do not have that option to learn Arabic, so inshaAllah we&amp;#8217;ll cover in this article some easy steps one can take to begin the process of learning Qur&amp;#8217;anic Arabic if they cannot travel to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Should I Read?</title>

      <description>Last month before summer ends, we let the days go by or wrap up summer courses before it all starts over again! To get that degree, we consistently keep up with projects, homework, study for tests, etc. And sure enough, most of us accomplish this &amp;#8216;goal&amp;#8217; within the time we aimed for.
But do we have similar goals for learning the deen? It might be something we admired&amp;#8211;and perhaps desired&amp;#8211;but never really worked for.</description>
