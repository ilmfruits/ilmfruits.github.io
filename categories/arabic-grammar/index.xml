      <description>This is post #35 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In this post, we will insha&amp;#8217;Allah do a word-for-word breakdown of each surah, as space permits.
In the first ayah, Allah (subhannahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala) says:
 لَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَٰذَا الْبَلَدِ
 The first two words, laa uqsimu (لَا أُقْسِمُ) literally means &amp;#8220;I do not swear.&amp;#8221; Uqsimu is mudaari&amp;#8217; mutakallim waahid, i.</description>

      <title>What is Hamd?</title>

      <description>Bismillah.
As Muslims, the phrase &amp;#8220;alhamdulillah&amp;#8221; الحمد لله (all praise and thanks is for Allah) is an integral part of our deen; we are taught to say it from both the Qur&amp;#8217;an and Sunnah. Linguistically, Hamd is from ha-meem-daal ( حمد or ح م د) and it is to mention the good attribute of a person, such an attribute that is the at the level of perfection. Hamd is based on mahabbah (love) and ta&amp;#8217;dheem (greatness).</description>

      <title>Words beginning with Fa</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/words-beginning-with-fa/</link>

      <description>Bismillah.
Learning Arabic as a second language may be difficult for many, so I decided to share some tips that assist with learning the meanings of words and their structures.
Words that begin with ف usually will always mean something that breaks open, separates, or breaks apart. Check out these examples:
الفجر (Al-Fajr) from ف ج ر means the dawn, but it literally means when the daylight breaks/crack through the darkness.</description>

      <title>The Calling Ya</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/the-calling-ya/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/the-calling-ya/</guid>
      <description>Arabic has something called the &amp;#8220;calling ya&amp;#8221; in it. The closest thing we have in English is the &amp;#8220;calling o&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;as in &amp;#8220;o my teacher&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Oh God!&amp;#8221; (As you can tell from the examples, we don&amp;#8217;t use it much anymore these days&amp;#8211;though, in Arabic, it&amp;#8217;s quite common.)
The rules are quite simple&amp;#8211;just like English, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;O so-and-so&amp;#8221;. So for example, you could say &amp;#8220;ya ummiy&amp;#8221; (o my mother) or &amp;#8220;ya taajiru&amp;#8221; (o merchant).</description>

      <title>Thumma, Wa, and Fa</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/thumma-wa-and-fa/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/thumma-wa-and-fa/</guid>
      <description>There are three conjunctions you can use in Arabic (among others)&amp;#8211;wa (and), thumma (then), and fa (which is difficult to translate, think of it as &amp;#8220;and&amp;#8221;). They are all used to group multiple items. What are the differences between these three?
Wa indicates grouping, but doesn&amp;#8217;t specify order or timing. For example: Ahmed and Ghufran and Yusuf travelled to the masjid. It doesn&amp;#8217;t indicate what order they arrived in, or anything about how long the people who came first waited for the people who came after then.</description>

      <title>Kaana as Emphasis</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/kaana-as-emphasis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2007 18:29:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/kaana-as-emphasis/</guid>
      <description>The word kaana is the past-tense masculine singular third-person (he) form of the verb to-be. So you can translate it as &amp;#8220;he was&amp;#8221;. (And the khabr takes the same rules as with any other verb.)
So what does it mean when Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) uses kaana to describe Himself? For example, in surah Nisaa, He says:
إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً  Translation: And seek the Forgiveness of Allah; surely, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful [Surah Nisaa, 4:106]</description>

      <title>Mubtada and Khabr</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/mubtada-and-khabr/</guid>
      <description>In Arabic, default kind of sentence is called a nominal sentence. It looks something like this:
 Ahmad is rich The masjid is big I am a Muslim  It has two parts&amp;#8211;the mubtada (the subject &amp;#8212; eg. Ahmad), and the khabr (the predicate&amp;#8211;information about the mubtada &amp;#8212; eg. rich, big, a Muslim).
What are the rules of grammar as they apply to the mubtada and the khabr? There are three:</description>

      <title>Laysa (Not)</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/laysa-not/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/laysa-not/</guid>
      <description>Laysa in Arabic means &amp;#8220;not&amp;#8221; (eg. that is not a pen). Unlike the other negations maa and laa, laysa is conjugated as a verb, depending on what you&amp;#8217;re negating.
For example:
 the duck is not big (al-battatu laysat kabiyratan) the cat is not lazy (al-qittu laysa bi kaslaana)  Whenever you use laysa, the mubtada and khabr change: the mubtada becomes ismu laysa, and the khabr becomes khabru laysa.</description>

      <title>Hadhaa Kitaabun vs. Haadhal Kitaabu</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/hadhaa-kitaabun-vs-haadhal-kitaabu/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2007 02:34:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/hadhaa-kitaabun-vs-haadhal-kitaabu/</guid>
      <description>One question that plagues many new students of the Arabic language is the difference between hadhaa kitaabun and hadhaal kitaabu &amp;#8230;
The difference is best demonstrated by example: hadhaa kitaabun kabiyrun means &amp;#8220;this is a big book,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;hadhaal kitaabul kabiyru&amp;#8221; means &amp;#8220;this big book &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
Get the difference? The first (hadhaa kitaabun) is talking about any book. &amp;#8220;This is a book.&amp;#8221; Nothing special. The second&amp;#8211;hadhaal kitaabu&amp;#8211;is talking about a specific book.</description>

      <title>Inanimate Object Plurals</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/inanimate-object-plurals/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/inanimate-object-plurals/</guid>
      <description>In Arabic, masculine plurals generally follow a couple of different patterns. Sometimes they acquire a waw-noon at the end (eg. muslim becomes muslimuwna)&amp;#8211;these are called &amp;#8220;sound plurals&amp;#8221; (because the original word is still intact). Some acquire letters inside their form (eg. qalam becomes aqlaam)&amp;#8211;these are called &amp;#8220;broken plurals&amp;#8221;.
Feminine words, Allahu &amp;#8216;alim, they also have sound and broken forms. One example of a sound feminine plural is muslimaat (plural of muslimah).</description>

      <description>Rules of Engagement  Rules of Engagement is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Muhammad ibn Faqih. The course teaches and emphasizes ethics, morality, rights, character attributes, and manners&amp;#8211;everything from the rights of children before they&amp;#8217;re born to the cause for the decline and destruction of socieities to the literally dozens of virtues one earns from sabr! The course focuses a lot on self-development, self-improvement, and dealing with others, as well as improving oneself.</description>

      <title>Number and Counted / ‘Adad and Ma’duwd</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/number-and-counted-adad-and-maduwd/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2006 12:44:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/number-and-counted-adad-and-maduwd/</guid>
      <description>Arabic has specific grammar rules for &amp;#8216;Aadad and Ma&amp;#8217;duwd&amp;#8211;the number and the counted.
Note: These rules apply for numbers from three to ten. One and two are special-they count as adjectives, not numbers, because the form of the word implies the number.
In English, we say &amp;#8220;three cars&amp;#8221;. Three is the number (&amp;#8216;adad), and cars is the counted (ma&amp;#8217;duwd).
What are the grammatical rules of &amp;#8216;adad and ma&amp;#8217;duwd?
Similar to time modifiers, &amp;#8216;adad and ma&amp;#8217;duwd work like possessive case.</description>

      <title>Time Modifiers / Duruwf Zamaan</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/time-modifiers-duruwf-zamaan/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/time-modifiers-duruwf-zamaan/</guid>
      <description>The Arabic language contains &amp;#8220;time modifiers&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;words like &amp;#8220;before&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;after&amp;#8221;. In Arabic, these are called Duruwf Zamaan, and grammatically, they act like the possessive case.
While there are tons of these in Arabic, there are two you run into pretty often in the Qur&amp;#8217;an and ahadith: ba&amp;#8217;da (after) and qabla (before).
Grammatically, the modifier comes before the thing it modifies&amp;#8211;the same as in English. And since the modifier acts like the possessor in the possessive case, the modified receives kasra.</description>

      <title>Possessive Case / Mudaf &amp; Mudaf Ilayh</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/possessive-case-mudaf-mudaf-ilayh/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/possessive-case-mudaf-mudaf-ilayh/</guid>
      <description>You&amp;#8217;re already familiar with possessive case in English&amp;#8211;when we show ownership of something. For example, we might say, &amp;#8220;this is Amer&amp;#8217;s book&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;this is the book of Amer.&amp;#8221;
The possessive case has two elements:
 The possessor, i.e. the one who owns the thing. In this case, Amer. The possessed, i.e. the thing being owned. In this example, the book.  The possessive case in Arabic is the same. The possessed is called the mudaf, the possessor the mudaf ilayh.</description>

      <title>Huruwful Jarr: Prepositions</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/huruwful-jarr-prepositions/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2006 22:28:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/huruwful-jarr-prepositions/</guid>
      <description>In English, we have words like &amp;#8220;from&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;to&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;with&amp;#8221;, etc. These are called prepositions. They exist in Arabic, too&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;huruful jaar&amp;#8221; (حُرُوقُ الجَرّ).
Huruwful jarr modify the words immediately after them, which are called &amp;#8220;majruwr&amp;#8221; (مَجرُور).
In Arabic Grammar, majurwr words always take kasra (either single or double). (The one exception is feminine names, which take fatha.)
So for example, if we have a book (kitaabun), then we add the preposition with (bi), it becomes &amp;#8220;bi kitaabin&amp;#8221; (بِ كِتَابٍ).</description>

      <title>Default Dumma and Definitivity</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/default-dumma-and-definitivity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2006 15:05:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/default-dumma-and-definitivity/</guid>
      <description>In Arabic grammar, the default harakaat that goes on all words is dumma (ُ or ٌ, the &amp;#8220;oo&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;oon&amp;#8221; sound). When you don&amp;#8217;t know the vowel, apply dumma. Other harakaat are for other cases&amp;#8211;for example, posessive case takes kasra (ِ or ٍ, the &amp;#8220;ee&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;een&amp;#8221; sound).
Harakaat are two types&amp;#8211;short (aa, ee, and oo) and long (aan, een, and oon).
The second point to remember is definitivity. A definitive object means a specific object, not just any old object.</description>

      <title>Arabic Word Gender</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/arabic-word-gender/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/arabic-word-gender/</guid>
      <description>Masculine and Feminine  In Arabic, all words are one of two genders: masculine, or feminine. There is no &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8221;, no third, gender-neutral gender like English has.
The main thing to remember is that when you don&amp;#8217;t know the gender, the default is the masculine gender. You also use the masculine gender for mixed groups (eg. if you&amp;#8217;re talking to a group of men and women).
The main sign of a word being feminine (remember, if you don&amp;#8217;t know, the default is masculine) is a specific form of the letter ta, called ta-marbuta (التَّأ المَربُوطَة), or &amp;#8220;tied-up ta&amp;#8221;, which looks like this:</description>

      <title>Arabic Grammar: It’s All in the Vowels</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/arabic-grammar-its-all-in-the-vowels/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2006 02:38:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/arabic-grammar-its-all-in-the-vowels/</guid>
      <description>Arabic Grammar consists almost entirely of putting harakaat on letters.
Arabic writing is typically written without the harakaat. How is it possible to read? One must learn slowly, piece by piece, and read with understanding. Arabic is not like English&amp;#8211;you have to actively read and consciously think while you read about what it means. (At least, when you start out.)
Why are harakaat important? Harakaat determine the meaning of words and sentences entirely.</description>
