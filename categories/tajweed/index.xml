      <title>Precision in Vowels</title>

      <description>To give your recitation a quick boost, try &amp;#8216;Itmaam-ul-Harakaat&amp;#8217;. No, it&amp;#8217;s not a medicine from Yemen. &amp;#8216;Itmaam&amp;#8217; simply means completion &amp;amp; &amp;#8216;harakaat&amp;#8217; could be loosely translated to mean vowels. It means fine-tuning the vowels. Unlike English, unitary vowels in Arabic are not letters &amp;#8211; thus not written out explicitly. Instead, they are shown with either of the following 3 marks above or below a letter.
Fathah: straight stroke on top of a letter, pronounced like the &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217; as in &amp;#8220;bat&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <title>Madd: Fard and Mustahab</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/madd-fard-and-mustahab/</link>

      <description>Madd (pronounced like &amp;#8220;mud&amp;#8221;), literally means &amp;#8220;extension&amp;#8221;. In recitation of the Qur&amp;#8217;an (tajweed), madd is when you extend and stretch a vowel sound (aah, ooh, etc.).
There are two types of madd: fard (obligatory: you have to recite it) and mustahab (recommended: you should recite it). The general rule is that a madd inside a word is fard, while a madd that connects two words is mustahab.
For example, in Surah Baqarah, Allah says:</description>

      <title>When is a Ya a Ya?</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/when-is-a-ya-a-ya/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/when-is-a-ya-a-ya/</guid>
      <description>In Arabic, there is the letter Ya: ي. It is pronounced similar to the letter Y in English.
However, there&amp;#8217;s also another type of ya&amp;#8211;the ya without dots, which looks like this: ى. As for that ya, sometimes pronounced as a ya, and sometimes, as an alif (ا).
For example, the word على (ayn-lam-ya) can be read as &amp;#8216;ala (on top: عَلَى) or as &amp;#8216;Ali (as in the name: عَلِي). So how do you know when to pronounce it as a ya, and when to pronounce it as an alif?</description>

      <title>Qalqala: Mnemonic and Mistakes</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/qalqala-mnemonic-and-mistakes/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/qalqala-mnemonic-and-mistakes/</guid>
      <description>Mnemonic: Something used to help you remember.
Qalqala is best described as an &amp;#8220;echo noise&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bouncing noise&amp;#8221;. There are five qalqala letters. If any of them appears with a sukoon on top, you perform qalqala. (Prime example, if you have no idea what qalqala is: the end of the last word of every verse in Surah Ikhlass.)
Qalqala letters: qaff (ق), ba (ب), taw (ط), jeem (ج), and dal (د).</description>

      <title>Learn Pronounciation in Surah Fatiha</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/learn-pronounciation-in-surah-faitha/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/learn-pronounciation-in-surah-faitha/</guid>
      <description>Surah Fatiha contains almost all the Arabic letters that the English language lacks: &amp;#8216;Ayn (ع), Saad (ص), Daad (ض), Taw (ط), Qaf (ق), and 7a (ح). Once you learn to pronounce these letters correctly, you practice them 17 times a day, every day, in every state of mind. Bi ithnillah, once you learn them, practice, and you will master them quickly.</description>

      <title>Tajweed Review Website</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/tajweed-review-website/</link>

      <description>If you know your tajweed (Qur&amp;#8217;anic rules of beautifying recitation) but feel a bit rusty or need to review them, this website explains it very well. The website helps more if you already know tajweed but need a refresher. It&amp;#8217;s very difficult to learn tajweed without a real, human teacher.
May Allah accept our reading of the Qur&amp;#8217;an as &amp;#8216;ibadah. Ameen.</description>
