      <description>Islam as a religion brings an answer to every single question that exists; this is why it is considered as the complete code of life. You can find the impressions of Islam in each part of a Muslim life, regardless of whether it is some financial issue, social, personal or any other thing related to life.
Among the different variables, something which makes Islam the top religion in the case of the contemporary existence of today&amp;#8217;s reality is the way that it is in total reverberation with the modern science that is a primitive instrument for the general population nowadays to judge anything.</description>

      <description>There he stood. A grown man, towering to the sky. Broad shoulders, and so much pain in his eyes. I know it&amp;#8217;s impossible, yet I could hear his heart sobbing. In reality though it was just the sound of my own pumping away. I stopped, asked, and what I was about to hear would break my heart in pieces. It&amp;#8217;s a painful encounter I&amp;#8217;ve heard over and over again of parents who&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8216;lost&amp;#8217; their children for one reason or another to drugs, alcohol, fame, money, friends, etc.</description>

      <title>Four Practical Steps to Taqwa, Step 1: Muhasabah</title>

The first practical step to gaining taqwa is accountability, known as muhasabah in Arabic; taking account of your actions. We see this concept from the beginning of Islamic history.:
In the Qur&amp;#8217;an In Surah Al-Hashr, Allah says:
 يا ايها الذين امنوا اتقوا الله ولتنظر نفس ما قدمت لغد واتقوا الله ان الله خبير بما تعملون
 Translation: O you who have believed, fear Allah .</description>

      <title>Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem Together</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2016/ar-rahman-and-ar-raheem-together/</link>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2016/ar-rahman-and-ar-raheem-together/</guid>
      <description>Allah introduces himself in Surah Fatiha as Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem, both. Both of these names derive their meaning from the word mercy (rahmah).
In classical Arabic, rahmah represents the mercy of a mother for her child. As the child grows, it causes the mother to be sick and weak; it eats nutrition from the mother; in the later trimesters, the child even stretches, punches, or kicks the mother&amp;#8217;s ribs! But still, the mother cares for, takes care of, and protects the child.</description>

      <description>Have you ever felt like you were drowning? Submerged in the depths of the world? With darkness encompassing you everywhere you went?
I have.
And what makes the situation even more difficult to swim through is when you don&amp;#8217;t know why. Everything seems to be on point; you&amp;#8217;re praying, going to the masjid, giving charity, etc. yet that feeling of drowning is ever-so-present.
What&amp;#8217;s going on? 
I want you to imagine an empty jar with dirt in it (or just look below).</description>

      <description>How do we hold on to some of the good habits we developed in Ramadan?
For many, Ramadan has slipped away from our mind as something of the past. However, this is an excellent time to refresh those memories and make new intentions moving forward.</description>

      <title>To Do List After Ramadan</title>

Ramadan ended. (May Allah accept all our prayer, fasting, du&amp;#8217;a, and good deeds during this blessed month &amp;#8212; ameen!) How should we, as Muslims, act now?
We graduated from the school of Ramadan; can life simply return to normal?
Our scholars mention a few points about this:
 Allah says, in surah Baqarah, that Ramadan was prescribed on us in the hope that we gain taqwa. Did we achieve that goal of the school of Ramadan?</description>

      <title>Attributes of a Successful Parent</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2015/attributes-of-a-successful-parent/</guid>
      <description>The sunnah mentions several characteristics of successful parents. Let&amp;#8217;s dive into some of them.
Hilm (Forebearance) and Hayaa (Modesty)  حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو إِسْحَاقَ الْهَرَوِيُّ، حَدَّثَنَا الْعَبَّاسُ بْنُ الْفَضْلِ الأَنْصَارِيُّ، حَدَّثَنَا قُرَّةُ بْنُ خَالِدٍ، حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو جَمْرَةَ، عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ قَالَ لِلأَشَجِّ الْعَصَرِيِّ ‏ &amp;#8220;‏ إِنَّ فِيكَ خَصْلَتَيْنِ يُحِبُّهُمَا اللَّهُ الْحِلْمَ وَالْحَيَاءَ ‏&amp;#8221;‏ ‏.‏
 Translation: It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said to Ashajj Ansari: &amp;#8220;You have two characteristics that Allah likes: Forbearance and modesty.</description>

      <title>The Elephant Theory</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2015/the-elephant-theory/</guid>
      <description>As we mentioned with the sandwich theory, with children, always separate the behaviour from the person. Never say things like, &amp;#8220;I hate you&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re a loser,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;idiot,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;stupid,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I wish I never had you!&amp;#8221; Some of us heard this from our own parents. Are we now our own parents? Are we passing on this disease? This DNA has to be out.
The elephant theory is quite simple: young elephants are trained, with one leg that&amp;#8217;s shackled to a cement block.</description>

      <title>Twelve Things About the Terrible Twos</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2014/twelve-things-about-the-terrible-twos/</guid>
      <description>Definition and Asl Definition: &amp;#8220;Terrible twos&amp;#8221; occur when children are between the ages of one and three years old. This is usually when children throw a lot of tantrums, and rebel, saying &amp;#8220;no!&amp;#8221; to many things you tell them. How can you effectively deal with this situation?
First, understand the root (asl): children cannot keep their strong emotions inside. They cry, they scream, they stomp, they fling themselves on the floor.</description>

      <title>The Responsibility of Children &#43; 21 Theory</title>

      <description>Responsibility: Reward and Punishment It&amp;#8217;s our responsibility to take are of our children, especially their akhirah &amp;#8212; their eternal life. Allah says:
Translation: O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones [&amp;#8230;] (Surah At-Tahrim, verse 66)
This ayah illustrates our responsibility: protect yourselves, and your children, from Hellfire &amp;#8212; a fire whose fuel is stones and men. Would you raise your children, knowingly, that they are going to be firewood, or fuel for the fire?</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
We live in an era where knowledge is abundant and is available at our finger tips in variety of formats (audio, video, ebooks&amp;#8230;) and on variety of devices and platforms (tablets, smartphones, laptops&amp;#8230;.). However, we lack the enthusiasm, passion, dedication and commitment to seeking knowledge. Here are few of the inspiring stories of past to rekindle that spark.
 Imam Zafar said &amp;#8220;We used to sit down and take our spots for the circle of Imam Ali Madini after the Asar prayer.</description>

      <title>Don’t Hesitate: Lessons from the Battle of Mu’tah</title>

      <description>One of the unique characteristics of the battle of Mu&amp;#8217;tah is that rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) appointed not one, but three commanders in the chain of command:
 `Abdullah bin &amp;#8216;Umar said: Allah&amp;#8217;s Messenger (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) appointed Zaid bin Haritha as the commander of the army during the Ghazwa of Mu&amp;#8217;tah and said, &amp;#8220;If Zaid is martyred, Ja&amp;#8217;far should take over his position, and if Ja&amp;#8217;far is martyred, Abdullah bin Rawaha should take over his position.</description>

 “There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.” [33:21].
 No matter what stage of life we are going through, or whatever roles we are trying to fill: be it be as father, husband, son, friend, leader and others, we will always find guidance in the life of our beloved Prophet(peace be upon him).</description>

      <description>Imam Bukhari, rahimahullah, is now a well-known scholar because of his saheeh collection of ahadith. It took him years to finish. But, this was not the beginning of his fame; in fact, the Muslims and scholars saw, from an early time, his intellectual strength and capability; he achieved fame well before he completed his most famous book.
Now, let us breeze through some details about the early life of this great scholar.</description>

      <description>Allah Subhannallah, tells us in the Quran:
 لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّـهِ أُسْوَةٌ
حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّـهَ وَ
وَذَكَرَ اللَّـهَ كَثِيرًا
 Translation:
There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.[Surah Al-Ahzab, verses 21]
The oxford dictionary defines the word &amp;#8216;role model&amp;#8216; as &amp;#8220;A person looked to by others as an example to be imitated.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, we introduced the topic of Differences of Opinions. We listed the four ways of categorizing these differences. In this post, we will look at the first category: Differences due to interpretation of word meanings and grammatical constructions.
Within this category, we have several sub categories:
Shared literal meanings/Equivocality/Homonym (Ishtirak):
An example of this would be the word &amp;#8220;qur&amp;#8221; which means menses as well as the time of purity between menses.</description>

      <description>Muslims, living in the Muslim Countries, generally tend to have limited exposure to Fiqh and its rulings. There is usually one dominant madhab and that&amp;#8217;s all people know about. Rarely, if ever, people are exposed to other madahibs. However, the situation for many of us living in west, like Canada, is quite different.
Because of the diversity of muslims, from various countries, cultures and backgrounds, we are exposed to many madhabs.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Nazi’at, Part 2</title>

      <description>This is post #43 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Continuing into our foray of tafseer of Surah An-Nazi&amp;#8217;aat, we reach the story of Musa (alayhi salaam). Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰ
 Translation: Has there reached you the story of Moses? [Surah Naazi&amp;#8217;aat, verse 15]
One of the interesting aspects of Qur&amp;#8217;an you don&amp;#8217;t get from the translation is discourse.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Nazi’at, Part 1</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is post #42 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, insha&amp;#8217;Allah we will take a whirlwind tour of the first third or so of Surah Naazi&amp;#8217;aat, a great and powerful surah of the Qur&amp;#8217;an. Then insha&amp;#8217;Allah we will go back and dive into more details (particularly in the Arabic side of things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّازِعَاتِ غَرْقًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّاشِطَاتِ نَشْطًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالسَّابِحَاتِ سَبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالسَّابِقَاتِ سَبْقًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُدَبِّرَاتِ أَمْرًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By those [angels] who extract with violence, and [by] those who remove with ease, and [by] those who glide [as if] swimming, and those who race each other in a race, and those who arrange [each] matter, &amp;#8230; [Surah Nazi&amp;#8217;at, verses 1-5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ayaat describe attributes of angels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripping Out:&lt;/strong&gt; Gharq (غَرْق) means to rip out, to yank out, to extract harshly. If you had a tree and you uprooted it, roots and all, that would be gharq. This refers to the angels who remove the souls of the corrupt and the evil-doers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gently Pulling:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse two contrasts verse one by mentioning nasht (نَشْط), which is like a gentle pulling. This refers to the angels that remove the souls of the righteous believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swimming:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse three refers to angels who &lt;em&gt;swim through the air&lt;/em&gt;; they are described as swimming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racing:&lt;/strong&gt; Verse four refers to angels who are racing; racing the souls of the righteous to Jannah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al-Mudabiraat:&lt;/strong&gt; Al-Mudabiraat are those angelswho settle the affairs of deen and dunya, in the dunya. They take care of floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters, among other things. Their name, al-mudabiraat, also implies that they are thorough planners and executers of those plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are &lt;em&gt;aqsaam&lt;/em&gt; (oaths), which is typical in Mecci surahs. What is Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) swearing to?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This is post #41 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In the previous two posts, we discussed the first three quarters of this juz; now, we move into the final quarter. After describing some of the punishments of Hellfire, Allah says:
 إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا
حَدَائِقَ وَأَعْنَابًا
وَكَوَاعِبَ أَتْرَابًا
وَكَأْسًا دِهَاقً
لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا كِذَّابًا
 Translation: Indeed, for the righteous is attainment/success &amp;#8211; gardens and grapevines, and full-breasted [companions] of equal age, and a full cup.</description>

In the previous post, we discussed the first 16 verses of Surah Naba&amp;#8217;. The remaining 24 verses discuss the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire; you should read them to extract the details. Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;re going to touch on a few points that are interesting.
First, a recap&amp;#8211;verse 16 talked about (a continuing discussion of) some of the blessings of Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) in the dunya on the people.</description>

      <description>This is post #39 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
The tafseer of Surah Naba&amp;#8217; really speaks for itself; it talks about the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire&amp;#8211;three strong, recurring themes in the last juz. And this is, of course, the first surah in Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Therefore, we&amp;#8217;re going to focus mostly on the linguistic meaning of the words in the verses, and some gleams of tafseer you might not extract from just reading the verses in Arabic.</description>

Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says in Surah Al-Ghaashiyah:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ
 Translation: Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming [event]? [Surah Ghashiya, verse 1]
The surah starts with a question, to make you think. The companions would say: Allahu wa rasuluhu a&amp;#8217;lam (know better), out of humbleness, even know they had an answer in mind.</description>

In the time of &amp;#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab, radiAllahu anhu, the second Khalifah, it was mandatory upon all the young girls to learn Surat an-Noor.
From the beauty of this Surah is that it begins with, &amp;#8220;[This is] a surah which We have sent down and made [that within it] obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember&amp;#8221; [Surat an-Noor: 1].</description>

      <description>This is post #37 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Allah says, in Surah Tariq:
 وَالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ
وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ
النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ
 Translation: By the sky and the night comer (At-Tariq), And what can make you know what is the night comer? It is the piercing star. [Surah At-Taariq, verses 1-3]
As we mentioned before, one of the characteristics of early and Mecci surahs, like this one, is that they begin with a qasam &amp;#8212; an oath, a testification.</description>

And (made him) sympathetic to men as a mercy (or a grant) from Us, and pure from sins [i.e. Yahya (John)] and he was righteous, and dutiful towards his parents, and he was neither an arrogant nor disobedient (to Allah or to his parents).</description>

 Sixth, observing Allaah’s kindness, goodness and bounties, both hidden and open.
 It is to be aware of the vast amounts of Mercy Allah subhanahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala has engulfed His slaves with. It is to recognize and accept the blessings of Allah subhanahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala and to show thanks for it.</description>

The grand importance of tawheed al-uloohiyyah is evident in the fact that the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam was commissioned to a nation that confirmed many aspects of the first two categories of tawheed but rejected worshipping Allah alone.</description>

      <description>This is post #36 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
In Surah Humazah, Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says:
 وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ
 Translation: Woe to every scorner (humazah) and mocker (lumazah). [Surah Al-Humaza, verse 1].
As we mentioned many, many times before in this series, wayl is a curse. And when Allah says wayl about someone, it&amp;#8217;s not a curse, but a statement of reality&amp;#8211;because He, &amp;#8216;azza wa jal, is not in need of cursing anyone.</description>

      <description>Umar (RA) passed by a garbage dump and stopped there, and it was as if his companions were bothered by it (the smell). He said [&amp;#8230; full story at the end&amp;#8230;]
What would you think of someone who goes for umra on a 1 week trip. He goes there, buys a car, clothes, house, grocery, &amp;#8230;.. He even takes dollars with him and doesn&amp;#8217;t exchange them into local currency! We would think that something is wrong with that person.</description>

      <description>Imagine this. You are speeding on the road. The police officer catches you, pulls you over and gives you a speeding ticket. What would your reaction be, next time you are driving especially driving through the same road. You would naturally slow down! Or you are stealing from your prayer (i.e. racing through it), you glance over and it seems like your friends might be looking at you. Your reaction&amp;#8230;. In these and in countless other situations, we refrain from doing bad because we fear that we might be caught or someone might be looking at us.</description>

      <title>Why Not Despair? Reflections on Patience</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/why-not-despair-reflections-on-patience/</guid>
      <description>Why not despair? The Islamic meaning of sabr is to stop ourselves from despairing and panicking, to stop our tongues from complaining, and to stop our hands from striking our faces and tearing our clothes at times of grief and stress.
To have _sabr_ is to first realize within your own heart that a) there is a god that exists b) that this god is worthy of all my worship c) that this god is indeed characterized by attributes of perfectness and majesty, which can only be ascribed to god and no other.</description>

In this post, we will insha&amp;#8217;Allah do a word-for-word breakdown of each surah, as space permits.
In the first ayah, Allah (subhannahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala) says:
 لَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَٰذَا الْبَلَدِ
 The first two words, laa uqsimu (لَا أُقْسِمُ) literally means &amp;#8220;I do not swear.&amp;#8221; Uqsimu is mudaari&amp;#8217; mutakallim waahid, i.</description>

وَلِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ
وَهَدَيْنَاهُ النَّجْدَيْنِ

Allah says:

 Translation: I swear by this city (Makkah) &amp;#8230; [Surah Balad, verse 1]
&amp;#8220;Laa uqsim&amp;#8221; literally means, &amp;#8220;I will not swear by.&amp;#8221; in Arabic language, it means &amp;#8220;this thing is so truthful, I almost don&amp;#8217;t even have to swear by it.</description>

This post is chronologically out of order, since Surah Quraish was revealed before surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah; but insha&amp;#8217;Allah khayr. Allah says:
 لِإِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ
إِيلَافِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَاءِ وَالصَّيْفِ
فَلْيَعْبُدُوا رَبَّ هَذَا الْبَيْتِ
الَّذِي أَطْعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٍ وَآمَنَهُم مِّنْ خَوْفٍ
 Translation: For the accustomed security of the Quraysh &amp;#8211; Their accustomed security [in] the caravan of winter and summer &amp;#8211; Let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.</description>

This is a translation from the original article in Arabic.
1- It is a cause to receive the Love of Allah azza wa jal. The Most High says:
إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ التَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves. (2:222)
2- It is a cause of success. The Most High says:
وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ  And all of you beg Allah to forgive you, O believers, that you may be successful.</description>

      <description>Eid Mubarak! As the sahaba would tell each other: May Allah accept our good deeds and your good deeds (from Ramadan). Ameen!
Ramadan is still fresh in your mind; the long days of fasting, the pain in your legs and back from taraweeh, and most of all, that biting regret that you didn&amp;#8217;t do enough.
Would you like to make the next Ramadan even better? With only five minutes worth of effort?</description>

      <description>Ramadan is coming to a close. Like the last half-kilometer of a 10km race, the finish-line is in sight. This is the time to pull out all the stops and to sprint, flat-out. This is the time when Laylatul-Qadar, the night where deeds are multiplied by more than one thousand, hides.
Are you ready for it?
Maybe you felt like Ramadan breezed by. Maybe you felt like you didn&amp;#8217;t do enough.</description>

As per the poll on our twitter account, there was consensus on their being a post on grammatical analysis of Surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah. So here you go insha&amp;#8217;Allah.
Standard Disclaimer: I am not an Arab (as in, fluent in Arabic) nor have I double-checked this in books of &amp;#8216;ulama discussing grammar; there is sometimes difference of opinion in grammar, as well; so take it as such insha&amp;#8217;Allah.</description>

Allah says, in Surah Qaari&amp;#8217;ah:
 الْقَارِعَةُ
مَا الْقَارِعَةُ
وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْقَارِعَةُ
 Translation: The Striking Calamity &amp;#8211; What is the Striking Calamity? And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity? [Surah Qaariah, verses 1-3]
As we mentioned, the phrase in verse three&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;wa maa adaraaka maa &amp;#8230;,&amp;#8221; is a phrase that means that, you cannot understand this thing&amp;#8211;Al-Qaari&amp;#8217;ah, the striking calamity.</description>

Calligraphy of Arabic, or maybe Al-Qur&amp;#8217;an, inscribed in metal!  Continuing our discussion of Surah At-Teen, we&amp;#8217;re going to insha&amp;#8217;Allah dive into the Arabic analysis. It&amp;#8217;s surprising how much subhanallah you can understand with only a partial learning/understanding; but didn&amp;#8217;t Allah say that it&amp;#8217;s a clear, easy to read book?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is post #27 in our series on Tafseer of Juz ‘Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Al-Burooj:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالسَّمَاءِ ذَاتِ الْبُرُوجِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالْيَوْمِ الْمَوْعُودِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the sky containing great stars. And [by] the promised Day. And [by] the witness and what is witnessed. Cursed were the companions of the trench. [Surah Al-Buruj, verses 1-4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Ashaab-ul-Burooj, the People of the Ditch, is pretty well-known; in fact, we have an &lt;a href=&#34;the-people-of-the-ditch&#34;&gt;entire 15-part series&lt;/a&gt; on this surah. Check it out insha&amp;#8217;Allah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah opens this surahs with testifications. Then he testifies: qutila ashaabul-&amp;#8216;uqdood. &amp;#8216;uqdood is another word for ditch. Qutila, literally, means &amp;#8220;they were killed.&amp;#8221; But Ibn Abbaas (radiallahu anhu) said, whenever you read qutila in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, it means lu&amp;#8217;ina&amp;#8211;cursed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allah cursed the People of the Ditch.&lt;/strong&gt; And Allah is not in need of cursing&amp;#8211;He can do anything, to anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lu&amp;#8217;ina means, they were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they _are_destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what great sin did they perpetrate in order to deserve this immense reward&amp;#8211;not only being cursed and destroyed, but &lt;em&gt;being documented in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, to be recited until the end of time&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

The noble she-camel, prized in the Arab society, was actually one of the signs Allah sent to a nation. What did they do with it?  Surahs are usually named by something unique in their content. But the sun (ash-shams) is mentioned in several surahs; so why is this one called Surah Shams?</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reason-of-revelation&#34;&gt;Reason of Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) told the companions about a man of the previous nations; a man who lived and fought jihad for over 1000 months (roughly 83 years, 4 months). (In case you didn&amp;#8217;t know, the previous nations lived longer than us&amp;#8211;like Prophet Nuh (alayhi salaam), who did da&amp;#8217;wah for nearly 1000 years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companions were amazed, and they said: how can we compete with him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And subhanallah, this is a gem. &lt;em&gt;Look at the companions.&lt;/em&gt; They &lt;strong&gt;prioritized and competed for the akhirah.&lt;/strong&gt; Subhanallah to the point that, they don&amp;#8217;t just try to do &amp;#8220;some good deeds before I die;&amp;#8221; not enough. They competed with each other&amp;#8211;but even that was not enough. Rather, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;they competed with all of the Muslims, ever, starting from the time of Prophet Adam, until the Day of Judgment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to really look at ourselves and see, how much are we like them? Or are we just vying for bigger houses, better cars&amp;#8211;more dunya?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tafseer Surah Abasa: What Really Matters?</title>

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s not dunya status that matters. Allah teaches us this again in Surah Abasa&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s the one with taqwa.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you feel if someone you love corrected you, in public, in front of everyone else? Would you feel condemned, or criticized? Would you take it more seriously than someone you don&amp;#8217;t like criticizing you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if &lt;strong&gt;Allah, the Lord of the Universe,&lt;/strong&gt; criticized you &amp;#8230; in public?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Michael Jackson&amp;#8217;s $25,000 gold-plated bronze coffin (hand-polished).  This post is a brief and timely diversion from our tafseer series.
Michael Jackson was one of the most popular and well-known celebrities and icons of the western world; and now, he&amp;#8217;s dead. As Muslims, what lessons can we learn from this event? I&amp;#8217;ve listed below some of the lessons that came to my mind:
 Your Life is a Box. The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) once drew a dot in the sand, and lines radiating out from it; he said (paraphrased), &amp;#8220;this is the human, and their plans/desires.</description>

      <title>3 Shields of Protection From Supernatural Forces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is post #22 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/forest-night-light.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; title=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1233&#34; /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;The protection of Allah is easily earned and very, very powerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims love talking about Jinns and black magic. Yet, when it comes to inoculating themselves from supernatural forces, Muslims are often either ignorantly doing &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of what they need to do, or proverbially standing on the interstate highway, woefully oblivious of thousands of cars speeding by at near-miss distances. And many of us, or people we know, personally &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even the newest Muslim is often quickly equipped with powerful shields of protection against these forces. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

The Sabab-un-Nuzool (reason of revelation) for Surah Fil well-known; you can read all about it, along with some lessons and gems, in this post by Sr. Mariam 3.36. Please read it, since I won&amp;#8217;t touch on those points.
I will mention, however, two points not mentioned there&amp;#8211;that the Christian tyrant king who brought his elephant, why did he decide to destroy the Ka&amp;#8217;bah?</description>

      <title>Say: O You Kafiroon …</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/say-o-you-kafiroon/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This is post #20 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Kafiroon, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْكَافِرُونَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;لَا أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلَا أَنَا عَابِدٌ مَّا عَبَدتُّمْ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِيَ دِينِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Say, &amp;#8220;O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.&amp;#8221; [Surah Kafiroon]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mushrikeen (polytheists) of Mecca tried many, many different techniques to get the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) to stop spreading Islam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this ayah was revealed, they decided to make a pact with him. They said, &amp;#8220;Look, how about this&amp;#8211;you worship our gods for one year, and we&amp;#8217;ll worship your God for one year.&amp;#8221; And to sweeten the deal: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ll go first.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they applied the Broken Record technique. Whenever the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) would try to speak to them about Islam, they would only repeat this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who are wondering why&amp;#8211;although it seems on the surface like a fair trade, it&amp;#8217;s not. Allah &lt;strong&gt;does not forgive shirk&lt;/strong&gt;, worshipping other than him; not even a single sujood, or a single du&amp;#8217;a, none of it is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clearly, this is not a contract the Messenger of Allah could engage with. So he refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he &lt;em&gt;refused&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the Mushrikeen said, &amp;#8220;ok, how about this&amp;#8211;just &lt;em&gt;speak highly&lt;/em&gt; of our gods, and we&amp;#8217;ll do the same for you.&amp;#8221; A smaller compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whenever people approached them, they would say, &amp;#8220;Well, we&amp;#8217;re trying to compromise (like &lt;em&gt;we&amp;#8217;re&lt;/em&gt; the good ones in this deal&amp;#8211;even though we kill our daughters and murder on whims and &amp;#8230;), but he&amp;#8217;s not agreeing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) went to the ka&amp;#8217;bah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/kabah-full.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Ka&amp;#039;bah, the House of Allah&#34; title=&#34;The Ka&amp;#039;bah, the House of Allah&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1206&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mushrikeen were there. And in front of &lt;strong&gt;everybody&lt;/strong&gt; he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #18 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series). Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;ll be kicking up the post frequency to three times a week in order to finish before Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يُكَذِّبُ بِالدِّينِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَذَلِكَ الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَى طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you seen the one who denies the Repayment? For that is the one who drives away the orphan, and does not encourage the feeding of the poor. [Surah Ma&amp;#8217;oon, verses 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the connection here&amp;#8211;verse one, the one who denies Ad-Deen, the Day of Repayment. And verse two and three? He drives away orphans, He doesn&amp;#8217;t encourage feeding of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t feed&lt;/em&gt; the poor. It&amp;#8217;s that he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t encourange&lt;/em&gt; feeding the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/empty-grave.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;empty-grave&#34; title=&#34;empty-grave&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1187&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graves &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah At-Takaathur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حَتَّى زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graveyards. [Surah At-Takaathur, verses 1-2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subhanallah, even though these verses were revealed over 1400 years ago, we still see the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; situation today. Al-Haakum means, it makes you compete with each other. At-Takaathur is rivalry, competition, in accumulating material things; thinking that life is about toys, and the one with the most (or most expensive) toys wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Takaathur?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/arabic-explanation-of-surah-takweer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #17 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/sun-in-space.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1177&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  When the sun is &lt;em&gt;kuwwirat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to digress a bit and jump back to Surah Takweer. This post is based on Shaykh Nouman Khan&amp;#8217;s tafseer, which heavily emphasizes the Arabic language. I hope you will find, as I found it, as a glimpse of a previously-unseen world, a depth of knowledge that just drips from the Arabic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in surah Takweer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; When the sun is &lt;em&gt;kuwwirat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230; [verse 1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of gems that we learn even from this first ayah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idhaa + Past-Tense:&lt;/strong&gt; Idhaa is an indicator of future-tense &amp;#8220;when (something will happen).&amp;#8221; Yet, kuwwirat is past-tense; why? This combination means &lt;strong&gt;something is so certain, it&amp;#8217;s like past-tense.&lt;/strong&gt; So Allah is saying &amp;#8220;when this happens,&amp;#8221; yet it&amp;#8217;s certain that it WILL happen; as certain as the past is past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominal Sentence:&lt;/strong&gt; The default in Arabic is to put the verb first&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;kuwwirat ash-shamsu.&amp;#8221; To reverse this into &amp;#8220;ash-shamsu kuwwirat,&amp;#8221; shows emphasis, and makes it a tougher, stronger sentence. This hints at the audience&amp;#8211;Mushrikeen in Mecca, the worst and most obstinate of them, who are listening to this revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Voice:&lt;/strong&gt; Allah could have said, &amp;#8220;When I wrap up the sun,&amp;#8221; but He didn&amp;#8217;t. Why? If you&amp;#8217;re biased against someone (say a political party), &lt;em&gt;no matter what they say&lt;/em&gt;, even before they open their mouth, you say, &amp;#8220;psshh.&amp;#8221; But here, passive-voice highlights the maf&amp;#8217;ool, the recipient of the action&amp;#8211;the sun, the stars&amp;#8211;instead of the doer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the meaning of kuwwirat, kawwara means to wrap something around something; it&amp;#8217;s used in the context of a turban, something long, that&amp;#8217;s wrapped around your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah is applying the same meaning here&amp;#8211;that the light of the sun, something that&amp;#8217;s long, will be kuwwirat, wrapped up. Wrapped up meaning, something will cover it, and it will no longer be visible; and it will be wrapped slowly, part by part disappearing&amp;#8211;the same way that Allah described the day as wrapping around the night and the night wrapping around the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something scary&amp;#8211;that you see the sun wrapped up, and losing its light. But &lt;em&gt;there&amp;#8217;s more&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/indeed-we-gave-you-al-kawthar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #16 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-in-mountains.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1168&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Indeed, We gave you Al-Kawthar.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Al-Kauthar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice [to Him alone]. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off. [Surah Kawthar, verse 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you know the hadith where the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) was napping under a tree, and he woke up, smiling; and he said, Allah revealed to me this surah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the &amp;#8216;ulama have discussed this&amp;#8211;is it possible that Allah sends revelation in a dream? The answer is, surprisingly, &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;; of the 6-7 ways, the most common is through Jibreel (alayhi salaam). Even here, there&amp;#8217;s no indication that the surah was revealed through a dream&amp;#8211;perhaps Jibreel (alayhi salaam) came to the Prophet once he had woken, and revealed it to him. (For more information, check our posts on Route 114: Uloom Al-Qur&amp;#8217;an)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verse 1, Allah says: Inna &amp;#8216;ataynaaka al-kawthar. These two words allude to an enormous giver, giving an enormous gift. Allah could&amp;#8217;ve just said: ataytuka al-kawthar; but that would&amp;#8217;ve been weak, human speech. Instead, he uses inna&amp;#8211;emphasis, and refers to himself in the &amp;#8220;royal we&amp;#8221; (something we have in English, too).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #15 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/horse-saddle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1159&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah begins Surah Aadiyaat by saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالْعَادِيَاتِ ضَبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُورِيَاتِ قَدْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَالْمُغِيرَاتِ صُبْحًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعًا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the &amp;#8216;aadiyaat, when they pant, and the muwriyraat striking (when their hoves strike the ground and make sparks), and the mughiyraat, at dawn (when they raid), stirring up thereby [clouds of] dust, arriving thereby in the center collectively, &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a qasam (oath), a big oath that spans five ayaat. I&amp;#8217;m going to dive into word-for-word translation, because no translation can do justice (without paragraphs of brackets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;Aadiyaat (عَادِيَات) are horses (plural: sound feminine plural, in fact). Not those horses you see Canadian Mounties riding; but real, true, WAR horses. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen war-horses (send us a picture!), they have a special, particular intensity to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dabhaa (ضَبْحًا) means to pant. Pant meaning, if you&amp;#8217;ve ever run in a 100-meter race, or tried to run until you&amp;#8217;re tired, and you start breathing heavily through your mouth&amp;#8211;that&amp;#8217;s panting. Why are the &amp;#8216;aadiyaat panting? Because they are &lt;em&gt;charging&lt;/em&gt; into battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll see lots of war concepts here. The Arabs at the time of the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) knew these things very, very well; and when Allah testifies, these things he testifies by&amp;#8211;nobody would deny them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muwriyaat (مُورِيَات) are also war-horses&amp;#8211;the ones that strike. Strike meaning, when they run, their hooves strike up sparks on the ground. I definitely don&amp;#8217;t encourage watching movies, so if you&amp;#8217;ve ever read seerah stories, or perhaps Lord of the Rings, or similar books, you might find these kinds of concepts in their battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mughiyraat (مُغِيرَات) are the raiding horses. In the time of the Prophet, they would have raids; you would see a whole army of horses and riders sweeping into a city, and they&amp;#8217;d kill everybody and destroy it. Mughiyraat are those raiding horses that they rode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Reality of Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 14th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/clock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;85741170&#34; title=&#34;85741170&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1147&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah &amp;#8216;Asr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالْعَصْرِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;By Time. Indeed, mankind is at loss. Except for those who have believed, done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.&amp;#8221; [Asr: 1-3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah swears by time&amp;#8211;which shows how enormous and noble this creation is. Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imam Shafi said about this revelation that had it been the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; revelation sent to mankind, it would have been enough.  What motivated him to say this?&lt;/p&gt;

Stand up and do more. Muslims don&amp;#8217;t retire or quit from working for the deen. Persist. Be like the flower that springs through concrete.
Allah says, in verse 3:
 وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ
 Translation: And raised high for you your repute.

      <title>Tafseer of Surah Duhaa</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-duhaa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2009 18:24:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-duhaa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 12th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/breakfast-on-bed.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1118&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Islam is about social service and shukr (thankfulness).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insha&amp;#8217;Allah in this post, we&amp;#8217;re going to discuss three points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The close relationship between Allah and His prophet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A glimpse of Paradise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A core theme of social services in Islam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) received revelation prior to Surah Duhaa. Then for a while, nothing. Umm Jameelah, the wife of Abu Lahab, came to him and said: &amp;#8220;I hope your shaytaan has finally left you.&amp;#8221; Because the Arabs used to say, if someone was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good at something, that they had a shaytaan helping them. (No doubt like some of the musicians today.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still nothing came. The people began to talk &amp;#8230; and they said, maybe his Lord has left him. Maybe He has abandoned him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Allah revealed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Duhaa, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَالضُّحَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By duhaa (the morning brightness after Fajr), and [by] the night when it covers with darkness, your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muúammad], nor has He detested [you].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This hadith is found in Bukhari and Muslim, and is quoted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=93&amp;amp;tid=58628&#34;&gt;Tafseer ibn Katheer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows us two things: first, that the people &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; when revelation came; that it was a big deal, and everybody knew about it. And second, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;the immense love of Allah for His prophet.&lt;/span&gt; How close their relationship&amp;#8211;that even something as small as this stress, Allah revealed verses on behalf of the prophet, to reassure him. Subhanallah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, Allah &lt;em&gt;swears&lt;/em&gt; by duhaa&amp;#8211;by the brightness of the day right after the sun has come up&amp;#8211;and by the night, as it covers up the day with darkness. (This shows the greatness of these creations&amp;#8211;that Allah swears by them. Who would deny these things? Nobody!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;font-size: 80%; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  What have you packed for the Hereafter?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this is our 11th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah Fajr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَأَمَّا الْإِنسَانُ إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَأَكْرَمَهُ وَنَعَّمَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَكْرَمَنِ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَأَمَّا إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَهَانَنِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, &amp;#8220;My Lord has honored me.&amp;#8221; But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, &amp;#8220;My Lord has humiliated me.&amp;#8221; [Surah Fajr, verses 15-16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice here, Allah is commenting on the mentality of the human race. When Allah gives &amp;#8230; the human being says: &amp;#8220;My Lord has honoured me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#8217;s all about wealth &amp;#8230; money &amp;#8230; dunya. This is the metric we use. You see the president of a country? You&amp;#8217;re very respectful. If the same president was a homeless bum asking you for change? You wouldn&amp;#8217;t even look at him. We equate money with respect and honour &amp;#8230; as Allah points out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the flip side? When Allah constrains the rizq, the human being says: &amp;#8220;My lord has humiliated me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #10 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Surah Layl, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَمَا خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَى&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; By the night when it covers, and [by] the day when it appears, and [by] He who created the male and female: &lt;em&gt;Indeed&lt;/em&gt;, your paths are diverse. [Surah Layl, verses 1-4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arabic (and in English), people talk. And when you want to really draw attention to something, you make an oath. Compare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child 1:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t break the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I swear by my mother&amp;#8217;s grave, that I didn&amp;#8217;t break the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would you pay more attention to? Obviously, the second child (by the way, don&amp;#8217;t swear by other than Allah, it&amp;#8217;s shirk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine two people talking&amp;#8211;your brother or sister, who you&amp;#8217;ve known forever, and the President of America. Who would you pay more attention to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lillahi mathalu al-&amp;#8216;alaa. This is &lt;strong&gt;Allah&lt;/strong&gt; talking to you. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; He&amp;#8217;s making an oath&amp;#8211;not just one, but three things! We should &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; pay attention here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what does He testify to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 4&amp;#8211;that your paths are different.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tafseer of Surah Al-‘Ala</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-al-ala/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:10:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/tafseer-of-surah-al-ala/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #9 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/tajmahal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Taj Mahal, a HUGE palace.&#34; title=&#34;The Taj Mahal, a HUGE palace.&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1082&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-&amp;#8216;Ala is one recited quite often; the Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to recite it in Witr, and in Jumu&amp;#8217;ah, and in &amp;#8216;Eid; and on days when Jumuah and &amp;#8216;Eid coincide, people would hear it in &amp;#8216;Eid, then again a few hours later in Jumu&amp;#8217;ah. This indicates &lt;strong&gt;the great importance&lt;/strong&gt; of Surah Al-&amp;#8216;Ala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you probably didn&amp;#8217;t know about this surah&amp;#8211;when we say &amp;#8220;Subhanna rabbiy al-&amp;#8216;alaa&amp;#8221; in sujood, that comes from this verse&amp;#8211;because the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded us to do so. This is where it comes from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive into some of the tafseer.  In ayah 9, Allah says:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #8 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/10123827.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;10123827&#34; title=&#34;10123827&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1070&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue on our journey through tafseer of Juz Amma, we come across Surah Takweer.  Surah Takweer begins with a description of the Day of Judgement.  What we have to keep in mind as we go through the surahs in chronological order is that these first surahs were teachhing big lessons and getting across major points.  In this Surah Allah t&amp;#8217;Ala tells us to think about the bigger picture.  In fact Allah t&amp;#8217;Ala &lt;strong&gt;shows&lt;/strong&gt; us what the Day of Judgement will be like.  All of this to help get our minds to focus on the big picture in life.  And what could be bigger than the  Day of Judgement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive into the verses, to understand them more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us know Surah Lahab. It&amp;#8217;s one of the first one Muslim children learn these days. We&amp;#8217;re going to breeze through the tafseer, then dive into one of the miracles, and finish up with some Arabic analysis.
Allah says:
 تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ
مَا أَغْنَى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ
سَيَصْلَى نَاراً ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ</description>

In verses 9 and 10 of Surah Iqraa, Allah says:
 أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يَنْهَى
عَبْداً إِذَا صَلَّى
 Translation: Have you seen the one who forbids a servant when he prays?
The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to make sujood to Allah in the courtyard of the ka&amp;#8217;bah in early times in Mecca, and nobody would stop him.</description>

In our last post, we talked about how the human race does taghaa if they see themselves as self-sufficient. Living in western societies, we see this all around us&amp;#8211;people racing, fighting, stealing, overworking, to make a few more dollars so that they can &amp;#8220;make it.&amp;#8221; They buy lottery tickets so they can &amp;#8220;make it&amp;#8221; and be rich, rich rich!</description>

      <description>Note: This is our 4th post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Allah says, in ayahs 6-7 of Surah Iqraa:
 كَلَّا إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَيَطْغَى
أَن رَّآهُ اسْتَغْنَى
 Translation: No! [But] indeed, man transgresses. Because he sees himself self-sufficient. [Surah Iqraa, verses 6-7]
Kalla is a very stern, emphatic warning. If your kid is being bad, you say &amp;#8220;laa, laa;&amp;#8221; and then they grab something hot off the stove and you say &amp;#8220;KALLA!</description>

      <description>Note: This is the third post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
From the opening ceremonies, to the first move of world leaders, people like to send a message. The intense revelation of the Qur’an is no different. The timing, style and content, sends a message to the final Prophet (saw) and to all of humanity.
Allah (swt) starts the revelation commanding the Prophet to read &amp;#8220;Recite in the name of your Lord who created.</description>

      <title>Arabic Analysis for First Revelation</title>

      <description>This is the second post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
The first five ayaat of Surah Iqraa are:
 اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ
خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ
اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الْأَكْرَمُ
الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ
عَلَّمَ الْإِنسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ
 Word-for-word translations are pretty common these days (like this one, which has Surah Iqraa), so I&amp;#8217;m going to touch lightly on that, and do a bit more grammar.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
Although the story is well-known amongst the Muslims, we will recap the story of the first revelation: Surah Iqraa (also known as Surah &amp;#8216;Alaq), revealed in Mecca.
Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal (rahimahullah) relates from &amp;#8216;Aisha (radiallahu &amp;#8216;anhaa) that the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam), for six months before revelation, would see true dreams that would happen the next day&amp;#8211;day after day after day, for six months.</description>

      <description>As you know, we cannot just accept a hadith from anyone&amp;#8211;this is our deen! If anyone could just say what they wanted, we would have nothing left of the true, pure message of Allah.
The scholars have analyzed the biographies of every narrator of hadith. They compile information on when he was born, and where, his kunya, his tribe, who he met, what his character was, what other people narrated about him &amp;#8230; piles and piles of information.</description>

      <title>Du’a for Laziness and Incapability</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/dua-for-laziness-and-incapability/</guid>
      <description>The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to make a du&amp;#8217;a:
 اللّهُمَّ إنِّي أعُوذُبِكَ مِن العَجزِ وَ الكَسلٍTransliteration: Allahumma inniy a&amp;#8217;oothubika min al-ajzi wal-kasli
Translation: O Allah, I seek refuge in you from incapability and laziness.  Why is this du&amp;#8217;a important? For two reasons:   Laziness is an attribute of munafiqeen. If this wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough, being lazy leads to procrastination, which leads to its own set of problems.</description>

Bismillah.
Salah. We cannot emphasize the importance of salah&amp;#8211;the dividing line of Islam and Kufr. The first thing asked about on the Day of Judgment. The last thing the Messenger of Allah mentioned before he passed away.

      <title>Futures: Halal or Haram?</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/futures-halal-or-haram/</guid>
      <description>Is futures trading halal or haram? Futures trading isn&amp;#8217;t just for investors&amp;#8211;even day-to-day transactions like buying and selling fruit, furniture, or funky gadgets can take the same ruling!
So is it halal? Or haram?
What exactly are futures? Futures trading generally apply to stocks, indexes, etc. Say you&amp;#8217;re trading currencies (such as the Japanese Yen). Normal trading is buying high and selling low; futures trading is &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll sell you 1000 Yen at this price, two months from today, and you pay me then.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2009/the-certainty-principle/</guid>
      <description>Edit: It&amp;#8217;s makrooh, NOT haram, to sell something when you&amp;#8217;re 50%+ sure it&amp;#8217;ll be used for haram.
In Islamic finance, permissibility to sell something is tempered by the certainty principle&amp;#8211;that is, how certain are you that this thing you&amp;#8217;re selling will be used properly?
Say you sell grapes in a specialty grape-only store. A few types of customers come in:
 A young woman comes in with her little boy and buys some grapes; you see her feeding him the grapes as soon as the cashier scans it through.</description>

      <description>One of the ways in which Islamic finance differs greatly from conventional law is in the debt-for-debt transaction. In Islamic finance, a debt-for-debt transaction is not allowed.
And this is one of the big factors in the current economic depression&amp;#8211;people selling a debt for a debt for a debt for &amp;#8230; one report says that America is built on debt seven times over! The guy at the bottom finally asks for his commodity, and all the people in the chain realize there was nothing there at all; it&amp;#8217;s all debt on debt.</description>

      <description>In Islamic Finance, the shari&amp;#8217;ah differentiates between two types of commodities (this is just one differentiation): specific, and non-specific.
Specific: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll sell you this Saheeh Bukhari printed in 2004 by Dar-us-Salaam that I&amp;#8217;m holding in my hand.&amp;#8221;
Non-Specific: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll sell you a copy of Saheeh Bukhari printed in 2004 by Dar-us-Salam.&amp;#8221;
So if you own some large amount of inventory, or you sell in volume, or you have a bookstore, etc.</description>

      <description>In the sciences of hadith, there&amp;#8217;s something called a &amp;#8220;mursal&amp;#8221; hadith. What exactly is a mursal hadith? What is it&amp;#8217;s status? What are the fiqh rulings on mursal ahadith? And why does it matter?
(Ok, for the answer to the last question, read and learn about the science of hadith. In a sentence: Scholars have devised an extremely rigorous process to determine which hadith are authentic, and which are not. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to spend your whole life following a &amp;#8220;hadith,&amp;#8221; only to find out it really wasn&amp;#8217;t legit, do you?</description>

      <description>Israel is bombing Gaza. Again. In two days, there are 400 dead and 1400 injured. Hospitals overflowing, boycotts, blood, and dead bodies&amp;#8230;
The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said the Muslim ummah is like one body&amp;#8211;if one part hurts, the whole body feels it and responds.
Do you feel the pain?

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a beautiful du&amp;#8217;a that Allah mentions near the end of Surah Baqarah:
وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا  Translation: So do &amp;#8216;affuw on us. And forgive us. And have mercy on us. [Surah Baqarah, verse 286]
Allah mentions three things, in order:
 &amp;#8216;Affuw &amp;#8216;annaa: Affuw linguistically means to erase something; to obliterate something; to completely destroy something and leave no traces of it whatsoever. This du&amp;#8217;a is saying: make affuw of our sins.</description>

The Messenger asked her, &amp;#8220;Do you pay Zakaat on this?&amp;#8221; She replied, &amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221; The Messenger said: &amp;#8220;Would it please you that Allah will encircle you with two bracelets of fire?&amp;#8221; The reporter commented that she took them off and threw them down in front of the Messenger, and said: &amp;#8220;They are for Allah and his Messenger.</description>

There are 6-8 billion people on the face of the earth. That&amp;#8217;s 6 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000. That&amp;#8217;s a lot of people! Can you imagine learning 6 names? Or 60? Or 6000? But Allah knows their names&amp;#8211;all 6,000,000,000 of them.</description>

Aqsaam (oaths) in the Qur&amp;#8217;an are a very fascinating subject that we should study and focus on more. There are a few components needed for a qasm (oath) to occur. One of them is the harf qasm, a letter that shows there is an oath being taken.
There are a few letters in the Qur&amp;#8217;an that are used as harf qasm, for example, Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala says &amp;#8220;wal &amp;#8216;aadiyaati dhabhaa&amp;#8221;. The harf qasm in this oath is the letter wow (و).</description>

 The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to pray Qiyaam-ul-Layl until his legs swelled. When asked why&amp;#8211;since Allah has forgiven all his past and future sins, he said: Should I not be a grateful slave?</description>

      <title>The Reasons Behind Seasons</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2008/the-reasons-behind-seasons/</guid>
      <description>Bismillah.
Why did Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) create seasons? All of this&amp;#8211;snow, leaves changing, hot summer days and freezing winter nights. In some countries&amp;#8211;like Canada, and the US&amp;#8211;you have places where Isha time starts around 11pm, or 12am (midnight), and Fajr starts arond 2-3am! You also have days where Isha starts at 6pm, and Fajr starts around 7am.
What can we learn from this?
The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gives this away when he narrates: &amp;#8220;Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) made the night short so you can pray, and the day short so you can fast.</description>

      <description>Bismillah.
Ar-Rahman: The Entirely Merciful, Ar-Raheem: The Especially Merciful 
Both of the names Rahman and Raheem come from the root Ra-ha-meem (ر ح م), these names are similar so they require a parallel explanation. What is Rahmah? Rahmah is mercy. In the dictionary it means: compassion, kindness and gentleness. Also when a person is kind, compassionate and tenderhearted towards the other. So Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem: The One who has a lot of Rahmah, The One who shows a lot of rahmah, He expresses a lot of Rahmah.</description>

Abdur-Rahmaan: Wa-Alykum As-salam&amp;#8230;..how was your volunteer experience at the seminar?
Zaid: Alhumdullilah. But&amp;#8230;. I worked so hard for this event but no one came to me and said any thanks or any words of appreciation!
Abdur-Rahmaan: Perhaps if you niyyah was correct, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be thinking like that. If only you were doing it sincerely for the sake of Allah and expecting reward only from Him. I think you need to see a heart specialist and get some x-rays!</description>

      <title>Praying Isha While The Imam Prays Taraweeh</title>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s well-known in our communities, alhamdulillah, that you can pray &amp;#8216;Isha behind an imam praying Taraweeh. (Which happens if you run late, very late, indeed!) But we&amp;#8217;re just going to dive a bit into the details of how and why this is.
Note: We do not issue fatwa! For that, please consult Islam Question and Answer!
First of all, there is a difference of opinion among the scholars about whether this is permissible or not.</description>

In a few days, the shayateen will be let loose and the difficulties will emerge. Ya Rabbi! Give this ummah the strength to fight the shayateen and keep us steadfast in the deen.</description>

Continuing in our series of the interpretation of Surah Ikhlas. We now move to the last verse of this beautiful chapter in which Allah says:
 وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ And there is none co-equal to Him Allah ends this surah in the same manner He began it: making clear His Oneness, His Uniqueness.

Rifa&amp;#8217;ah ibn Rafi&amp;#8217; said: We were praying behind the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam and when he raised his head at the end of the rak&amp;#8217;ah he said:
 &amp;#8220;Allah listens to him who praises Him&amp;#8221;

A man behind him said:  &amp;#8220;O our Lord! To You belongs all praise, abundant good praise, inherently blessed&amp;#8221;

In one of the most beautiful beginnings of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala starts surah Saad with a powerful reminder. He says:
صۚ وَالْقُرْآنِ ذِي الذِّكْرِ
Saad. And by the Qur&amp;#8217;an, full of dhikr! [Surah Saad, verse 1]
This ayah begins with a letter, which are known as: huroof muqatta&amp;#8217;aat, the disjointed letters. There are many opinions as to what these letters mean, but the greatest and strongest opinion is that none but Allah ta&amp;#8217;ala knows their meanings.</description>

For the most part, or at least from my personal experience, from childhood salat was always made to seem very rigid; one way of doing it, no variation, very systematic. And since we were never taught these variations, salat just ended up becoming a thoughtless set of actions, repeating the same things over and over again. However, as I grew older I realized that there is a lot of variation in salat, a lot that we can do to really build that relationship Allah throughout our salat.</description>

This is another word that is very common in the Muslim&amp;#8217;s vocabulary. We all have heard the word, we all say it in our prayers daily (inshallah), yet how many of us truly understand its meaning?
Commonly this word is translated as, &amp;#8220;Glory be to Allah&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;All Glory is to Allah&amp;#8221;.</description>

There are certain words and phrases which we pronounce in our salat repeatedly, yet more than likely we do not know what they mean. This is the state of our salat these days&amp;#8230;nothing more than actions of the limbs. O Muslims! Remember faith (eman) is belief in the heart, statements upon the tongue, and actions of the limbs. All three are required for a completeness of faith.</description>

As Muslims, the phrase &amp;#8220;alhamdulillah&amp;#8221; الحمد لله (all praise and thanks is for Allah) is an integral part of our deen; we are taught to say it from both the Qur&amp;#8217;an and Sunnah. Linguistically, Hamd is from ha-meem-daal ( حمد or ح م د) and it is to mention the good attribute of a person, such an attribute that is the at the level of perfection. Hamd is based on mahabbah (love) and ta&amp;#8217;dheem (greatness).</description>

While we recommend everybody to get a colour-coded Arabic-text mushaaf&amp;#8211;because it makes it easy to recite with 100% perfect tajweed once you learn the rules&amp;#8211;sometimes, deciphering some of the symbols can be a bit tricky.
In this first post, we&amp;#8217;re going to insha&amp;#8217;Allah discuss different stops in the mushaf. You may have seen these stop symbols: tiny little letters (meem, qaaf+lam, jeem, saad+lam, lam+alif) written above the text.</description>

What? All of them?
Yes. all of them.
How does that work? In Islam, we have scholars (&amp;#8216;ulama), and we have people who have the knowledge and tools and responsibility to give fatwa (mujtahidoon).</description>

Why do we only feel this way in these gatherings?
Allah azza wa jal provides the answer:
He says in Surah Ra’d ayah 28:الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوب

We explained how the sunnah is comprised of the saying and actions of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam along with his tacit approvals and that which he left given the need. We also summarized how the sunnah came to explain the Qur&amp;#8217;an by detailing rulings which were very general in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, by limited what seemed absolute, by affirming what Allah said in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, and by bringing rulings which are not directly found in the Qur&amp;#8217;an.</description>

      <description>Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wasalam &amp;#8216;ala Rasool Allah
Asalamu &amp;#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatahu,
Continuing in our talks about the science of fiqh, today we will look at the sources of Islamic Law.
As we know the sources of Islamic Law depend on two core sources: al-Qur&amp;#8217;an and as-Sunnah. These two sources are the basis of which our religion is based upon. One without the under is not Islam, for verily they both go hand in hand.</description>

      <description>Asalamu &amp;#8216;alaikum, Time comes and goes; some people grow, some people remain exactly same throughout time.
وَالْعَصْرِ
By the Time!
إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ**_
_** Indeed! Mankind is in loss__
Thus, Allah makes clear that by the passing time man is in complete loss. Why? Because they don&amp;#8217;t take heed, they don&amp;#8217;t learn, they don&amp;#8217;t listen, they go on doing what their hearts desire without thinking twice. They (in general) don&amp;#8217;t ponder about the real purpose of their life; they (in general) cover reality with their false notions and desires.</description>

      <description>So far, we have come to realize that Allah azza wa jal revealed the Qur&amp;#8217;an to reform human conditions; to take people out of ignorance and darkness and into light. To carry out this purpose laws had to be enacted to make sure the system of Islaam was established perfectly and correctly. Last article we talked about two of the four basic principles relating to Qur&amp;#8217;anic revelation. We will continue with the last two now.</description>

      <description>As per the last discussion, the Foundational stages of Fiqh are characterized by the Prophethood of our beloved Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam. It is in the life time of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam that rules, which would govern fiqh for generations to come, were established. These rules were established via the statements of Allah subhanahu wa ta&amp;#8217;ala found in the Qur&amp;#8217;an and also the Sunnah of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam.</description>

      <description>Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wasalam &amp;#8216;ala Rasool Allah
It is imperative to realize that fiqh has gone through many developments/stages, which traditionally fall into six categories:
 Foundational Stage &amp;#8211; This period is characterized by the Prophethood of Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wasalam which lasted for 23 years (610 &amp;#8211; 632 CE) Establishment Stage &amp;#8211; This period is characterized by the Righteous Caliphs radhiAllah anhum which lasted for 29 years from the death of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam (632 CE) to the midle of the 7th century (661 CE) Building Stage &amp;#8211; This period is characterized by the founding of the Umayyad dynasty until its decline to the middle of the 8th century Flowering Stage &amp;#8211; This period is characterized by the rise of the &amp;#8216;Abbaasid dynasty in the middle of the 8th century to the beginning of its decline around the middle of the 10th century Consolidation Stage &amp;#8211; This period is characterized by the decline of the &amp;#8216;Abbaasid dynasty to the murder of the last &amp;#8216;Abbaasid Caliph in the middle of the 13th century Stagnation and Decline Stage &amp;#8211; This period is characterized by the sacking of Baghdad in 1258 CE to our present times  This gives us a brief overview of the developments of fiqh.</description>

When we begin to talk about a field of study in the religion of Islam it is very imperative we begin by defining the terms; making clear the terminology which is used throughout that field of study. With that said, I want to focus on Fiqh.
Linguistically, fiqh is defined as the true understanding of what is intended. For example: The true understanding of Anatomy, the true understanding of Plants, or the true understanding of Religion.</description>

      <description>Bismillah
Many scholars like Imam Bukharee rahmatulillah alay and Imam Muslim rahmatulillah alay have clarified the dangers of using da&amp;#8217;eef (weak) ahadeeth. Of the scholars that have used weak ahadeeth, they have done so with very strict conditions.
Ibn Hajar al-Askalani rahmatullilah alay, the father of the scholars of hadeeth, has said da&amp;#8217;eef ahadeeth are only to be used when the following conditions are met:
 It is well accepted amongst the scholars of hadeeth that the weakness is only minor.</description>

      <description>Victory comes only by the decree and permission of Allah, and this is true whether the victory is a small personal victory (like meeting a personal goal), the victory of a nation (like winning a battle), or the victory of passing the tests of dunya (like overcoming temptation and lowering your gaze). The evidence that supports this rule is ample, and the quality of the evidence—subhaanAllah, the stories are amazing! One such story comes from Suratul-Fil (The Elephant), and even a moment of reflection upon the story resonates with a message about the Supreme Power of Allah.</description>

The first is that one of you says &amp;#8216;Subhan Allah&amp;#8217; ten times, &amp;#8216;al-Hamdu lillah&amp;#8217; ten times, and &amp;#8216;Allahu Akbar&amp;#8217; ten times after each prayer.</description>

&amp;#8230;عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَنِ  In ayah 64, He describes these &amp;#8220;slaves&amp;#8221; by saying:
َالَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَبِّهِمْ سُجَّداً وَقِيَاماً …  This is translated as: those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrating (in sujood) and standing.

The Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:
إِنَّ لِلَّهِ تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا مِائَةً إِلاّ وَاحِدًا مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ .  Translation: Indeed, Allah has 99 names (one hundred minus one); whoever memorizes them will enter Jannah. [Saheeh Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim]</description>

(Can someone suggest some good links that detail his biography?)

And, just like ahadith, qira&amp;#8217;aat have different types. What kind of types? Four types, actually:
 Saheeh: Authentic qira&amp;#8217;aat. To be saheeh, a qira&amp;#8217;ah must have an authentic chain of narration back to the Prophet (S), and it must conform with the Uthmanic mushaf. There are ten of these puppies&amp;#8211;not seven, as is the common misconception.</description>

      <description>So what exactly is the Qur&amp;#8217;an?
Scholars define the Qur&amp;#8217;an as this: The Arabic speech of Allah that was revealed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) both in word and in meaning. It is collected between the two covers of the mushaaf, was narrated in mutawaatir chains, and is a challenge to humankind.
We can learn five important things about the Qur&amp;#8217;an from this definition.
 The Arabic speech of Allah: The Qur&amp;#8217;an is the speech of Allah, in Arabic.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه‏) was the second khalifa, and one of the ten companions promised Jannah in their lifetimes.
&amp;#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه‏) used to be a soldier&amp;#8211;one of the best. But when he became the khalifah, the other companions refused to let him fight&amp;#8211;he disagreed with them, but in the end, he stayed back in Medinah while the battles waged. Yet he always made one du&amp;#8217;a, publicly and privately, throughout his khilafah: &amp;#8220;Allahumma ruziqniy shahaadah,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;O Allah, provide me with martyrdom.</description>

      <description>Having been in Medina for so many years, Allah willed that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the Companions would return back to Makkah. Thousands marched forth to perform hajj with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that year and in that congregation he made a very important address. This was to be known as the Farewell Hajj, this was his farewell to his companions, a farewell message to the believing ummah, and in this farewell he said: &amp;#8220;I am leaving behind two memorable things, the Book of Allah and my sunnah, whoever abides by these will never go astray.</description>

      <description>Bismillah.
The study of hadeeth is one of the most noble sciences in Islam. The precision of this science, and the scholars who perfected it, is amazing and is not found in any other science&amp;#8211;secular or Islamic. The sciences of hadeeth may be the most disputed science in Islam, simply because people do not understand the succinct process and scrutinization for only one narration to be accepted as authentic (saheeh). The Sunnah is the second source of legislation after the Qur&amp;#8217;an, and Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) promised to protect the Sunnah:</description>

      <description>Arafah: the main day of Hajj. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said in one hadith: &amp;#8220;Hajj IS Arafah.&amp;#8221; [Sunan Abu Dawud, book 10, #1944] How true that is&amp;#8211;if you go to Arafah, but miss everything else, your Hajj is sound; and if you do everything else, but miss Arafah, your Hajj is not valid.
How much more important can you get than that?
Arafah, the day when millions of poeple gather in one place at one time to praise and supplicate to Allah.</description>

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;Surely, among the best of your days is Friday; so increase in (invoking Allah&amp;#8217;s) salaat upon me during it, for your (invocations for Allah&amp;#8217;s) Salaat (upon me) will be displayed to me.</description>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) carries on to mention many other characteristics of the believer in this surah&amp;#8211;however, the thing to focus on, the thing to ponder about, is that the FIRST characteristic that Allah chooses to describe a believer by&amp;#8211;a person who establishes the salaah.</description>

قُلْ أَطِيعُواْ اللّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ  Translation: Say: If you should love Allah, then follow me (so) Allah will love you and forgive your sins. And Allah is Al-Ghafuwr (the All-Forgiving), Ar-Raheem (the All-Mericful). Say, Obey Allah and His Messenger. But if you turn away then indeed, Allah does not love the disbelievers.</description>

They touch on the importance of good Islamic character: being truthful, avoiding lying, the evil of a suspicious mind, heedlessness, not protecting each other&amp;#8217;s honour, etc.
As a good reminder to the sincere heart, even if you have been blessed with guidance to the Sunnah and hold yourself to be from Ahlul-Haqq, the Shaytaan will not leave you alone.</description>

(Then) they will be permitted to enter Jannah.

One such project is Ilm Sieve, an Islamic search engine. Built on top of Google technology, it filters out non-Islamic and un-Islamic sites to give you only the best of Islam on the web. Some of the benefits of Ilm Sieve are:
 Signal-to-Noise: compared to searching on Google, almost all (if not all) the search-results you find in Ilm Sieve are from Islamic sites&amp;#8211;so no more digging to find the Islamic sites in page five and six of the results!</description>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) uses amazing parables in the Qur&amp;#8217;an that strike fear, awe and amazement in the hearts of the believers. Throughout the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) draws parables for us to convey the importance of certain topics, to extract lessons from them and so that we may ponder and reflect over them. We hear many times of the examples of the hypocrites, the mushrikeen (pagans) and the believers. But there is one parable that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) puts forth that increases the love and mercy between a husband and wife, and this parable is one of the most eloquent and striking in the Qur&amp;#8217;an.</description>

Tawaf, Islamically, means circling around the Ka&amp;#8217;bah for Hajj in the way the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) did and told us to do. The requirements of tawaf are simple&amp;#8211;be in a state of wudoo.
The mechanics of tawaf are:
 You walk around the ka&amp;#8217;bah, seven times Start at the Black Stone corner (from outside, it has a green light); raise your hand towards the Black Stone and say &amp;#8220;Allahu Akbar&amp;#8221; (or, if you can reach it, touch the black stone and say Allahu Akbar) For men, if possible, you walk quickly (raml, in Arabic) the first three times Make du&amp;#8217;a, recite Qur&amp;#8217;an, or make dhikr as you walk.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, on the day of Eid-ul-Adha:
Abdullah: As-Salam Alykum, Eid Mubarak..Taqabal Allah minna wa minkom! (May Allah accept it, from us and from you)
Abdur-Rahman: Wa &amp;#8216;Alykum As-salam. Eid Mubarak to you as well.
Abdullah: How has been your Eid day so far?
Abdur-Rahman: Man, I heard this new song today, and kept listening to it :( I know I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have been listening to music, it&amp;#8217;s haram, but I just can&amp;#8217;t give it up.</description>

The sacred month of Muharram is now upon us, and a new year has begun alhamdulillah. InshaAllah I wanted to remind you all and myself of the great sunnan this month has for us:
Rasulllah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;The best of fasting after Ramadaan is the month of Allah, Muharram, and the best of prayer after the obligatory prayers is prayer at night (qiyaam al-layl).&amp;#8221; [Saheeh Muslim, #1163]</description>

      <description>Can you re-use water used for purification&amp;#8211;wudoo or ghusl? This issue doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to most people unless they&amp;#8217;re stuck somewhere without much water&amp;#8211;like Cambodia, where they get water once a year, during flood season, and keep it for nine months.
(Before you read this, read about the three-fold categorization of water; in summary, water can either be purifying (tuhoor), pure (taahir), or impure (najas), and we can only use purifying water for wudoo and ghusl.</description>

This is important&amp;#8211;your du&amp;#8217;a is at stake! If you eat from haraam, Allah will not accept your du&amp;#8217;a.
Scholars agree that all utensils made from pure and clean things&amp;#8211;other then silver and gold, because we&amp;#8217;re prohibited from eating from those&amp;#8211;are pure and clean. So throw out your silverware, even if it&amp;#8217;s only partially silver; gold plating is not allowed, either.</description>

      <description>Hajj is an amazing act of ibadah&amp;#8211;one that requires everything: mind, body, and wealth. People invest so much time, so much energy, and so much money into Hajj&amp;#8211;and for what? What do they get out of it?
For a properly-intentioned, well-planned and correctly-executed Hajj&amp;#8211;one free of, for example, arguing, pushing, and harming other Muslims, full of patience&amp;#8211;there are five jackpots you cash out on when you perform Hajj:
 Deeds: The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this house&amp;#8211;the Ka&amp;#8217;bah&amp;#8211;and does not commit any obscenity and wrongdoing, he, or she, will come out as the day he or she was born,pure and free from sins.</description>

There are many words in Arabic that translate as &amp;#8220;love&amp;#8221; in English; two of them are hubb and wudd. What is the difference between hubb (حَبَّ) and wudd (وَدَّ)? Hubb, which is from ح ب ب ، means to love. It is a love that you have for someone or something that you keep inside of you&amp;#8211;inner feelings of admiration and fondness. While wudd, from و د د، is a more intense form of hubb, a whole-hearted and deep love.</description>

Confusion abounds.
How would you like a sneak peak at the shopping list of someone who attended Hajj several times in the last few years? Someone who changed their focus from attending Hajj to helping others excel at Hajj?</description>

Are they different? What&amp;#8217;s the scoop? Why do some people say fard, while others say wajib for the same things?
The answer is simple. According to the majority of scholars, fard and wajib mean the EXACT same thing. There is no difference. They are interchangable. (Recall that fard means: an action that, if performed, entails reward, and if neglected, entails punishment.</description>

 A man in the past worshipped Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) continuously for 500 years. He was granted a shelter on top of a mountain that was surrounded by salty water. However, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) caused a stream of sweet water to flow through the mountain for that individual.</description>

An eye-opener for those who believe &amp;#8230;
While talking to himself, Ibn Al-Jawzi blamed his soul in a gentle way. He said:
 I found myself in trouble, and so I made du&amp;#8217;aa (supplication) consistently, all the while requesting relief and comfort. The response to my du&amp;#8217;aa seemed to be delayed, and so my soul became disturbed and worried.
However, I rebuked it saying, &amp;#8220;Woe unto you; look attentively at yourself, are you the one possessed or are you the possessor?</description>

      <description>The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;The Pen is lifted from three (i.e., their deeds are not recorded):
 a child until he reaches puberty; an insane man until he comes to his senses; one who is asleep until he wakes up.&amp;#8221;  [Recorded in Abu Dawud #4403, and Ibn Majah #2041]
This is an important hadith, fundamental to usool-ul-fiqh. This hadith applies in practically every situation and with every issue.</description>

      <description>Umm Salamah! What an eventful life she had! Her real name was Hind. She was the daughter of one of the notables in the Makhzum clan nicknamed &amp;#8220;Zad ar-Rakib,&amp;#8221; because he was well known for his generosity, particularly to travelers. Umm Salamah&amp;#8217;s husband was Abdullah ibn Abdul-Asad, and they both were among the first people to accept Islam. Only Abu Bakr and a few others, who could be counted on the fingers of one hand, became Muslims before them.</description>

      <title>Is not Allah Alone Worthy of our Worship?</title>

      <description>My brothers and sisters in Islam, As-salamu &amp;#8216;alaikum!
To testify that there is One Creator who sustains, nourishes, and controls is not enough for the Muslim. The Muslim is one who believes and testifies that indeed Allah is the Creator, the Nourisher, the Sustainer, and also affirms that ONLY He is worthy of worship.
Our testimony of faith is not, &amp;#8216;La Rabba ill Allah&amp;#8217; (There is no Lord except Allah), because if this was the case then even the mushrikeen of the time of our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) believed and testified that Allah was the sole Creator.</description>

      <description>So, another Ramadan has come and gone! 30 days of reading Qur&amp;#8217;an and feeding the poor, 30 nights of Qiyaam-ul-Layl and Taraweeh and Tahajjud. And so, &amp;#8216;Eid comes again.
Congratulations! You have been one of those lucky few who lived to receive this great blessing from Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), this chance to get all your sins forgiven! Because the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;Whoever fasts during Ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah&amp;#8217;s rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven.</description>

      <description>What does it mean to say &amp;#8216;La Illaha Ill Allah&amp;#8217;? Has one every truly sat back and wondered what makes this one testimony so special? What makes this the differentiation point between one who believes and one who doesn&amp;#8217;t? Truly, it is every Muslims responsibility to comprehend fully what this Kalimah entails, because without it, one has not fulfilled the conditions of this testimony.
Someone asked a scholar of the past, &amp;#8220;is not the Shahada the key to Jannah?</description>

      <description>Why are you fasting? The answer to this questions determines your reward on Judgment Day. Monks fast. Some poeple fast to lose weight. Is it a cultural thing?
Or is it because Allah is worthy of worship, and only He deserves your fast? That you are seeking His reward? This is what the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;Whoever fasted Ramadan with belief, hoping for the reward from Allah, all his previous sins will be forgiven.</description>

      <description>Of the categories of tawheed, the most common one is that of making Allah One and Unique in His Lordship i.e Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah. The meaning of this is believe that only Allah creates, sustains, and nourishes the entire creation. Of the manifestations of this are:
 every object must have a creator no object can escape that which is decreed when in distress all of mankind calls out to his Creator.</description>

Their reading of Qur&amp;#8217;an in Ramadan:
 Salam ibn Abi Muti&amp;#8217; informs us that Qatadah used to normally complete reading the Qur&amp;#8217;an in 7 days, but in Ramadan, he completed it in three days.</description>

      <description>The importance of salaah can be seen in the seerah of our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). Allah raised our beloved Prophet to His heights to give him the command of salaah directly, rather than sending it through Angel Jibreel. Also, the importance of salaah is seen in the seerah, when the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was on his death bed, when he had the chance to give one last message that he could give his ummah until the Day of Judgment.</description>

      <description>The greatest command after that of tawheed is of salaah. Allah lays out a list for whom this Qur&amp;#8217;an is a guidance, and amongst the first things He says are about those who establish the salaah; those who guard them strictly and stand in front of Allah with obedience. The example of Prophet Ibrahim (عليه السلام) is amongst the best, and as he builds the ka&amp;#8217;ba, he makes du&amp;#8217;a to Allah to make him amongst those who establish salaah.</description>

Ramadan is of a countable number of days, so we have to be smart, and think about how can we MAXIMIZE the rewards we earn! Inshallah following is a list of ibada that take less time and have big reward. We need to be smart and think like a businessman (small investment -&amp;gt; big profit)
Remember reward of every deed is multiplied in Ramadan.
 Get the reward of hajj and umrah every single day Be smart in your dhikar Get the reward of fasting many Ramadans Get the reward of performing salaah the whole night Earn the reward of reciting one third of Qur&amp;#8217;an in few minutes:</description>

      <description>We at times find ourself in a race with salaah. One of the primary ways to gain khushoo in our salaah is to take our time in it, so much so that our Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) told us to be slow and articulate with each movement&amp;#8211;we should let all our bones rest and then continue on, not before that. No need to race, because this will come back on the Day of Judgment!</description>

Ramadan offers us a very unique opportunity. Ramadan offers us the opportunity to start fresh. It may not necessarily have the &amp;#8220;wash-away-all-your-sins&amp;#8221; publicity that Hajj does, but Ramadan gives us a chance to put ourselves through a mind, body and soul detoxification.</description>

THAT&amp;#8217;S Ramadan for you!

He (سبحانه وتعالى) has taught our forefather Adam (عليه السلام) the words of repentance and He taught Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) a very special dua. The dua is called the sayyidul istaghfar, and it is one of the pearls from the Sunnah that we should know.</description>

      <description>Khushoo is to be conscious of God, to have taqwa, to have fear of Allah. And so khushoo is something that comes from the heart, and if the heart is clean, then the salaah&amp;#8211;and everything else&amp;#8211;will be clean. There are many ways that one can go about gaining khusoo; a few of them a few are:
 prepare ahead of time by performing wudoo properly use miswak repeat the words of the adhaan make du&amp;#8217;a between the adhaan and the iqaamah  For more information, listen to the podcast below.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a very very deep name—like all of Allah&amp;#8217;s names, it&amp;#8217;s very deep. It comes from the root hilm, and hilm means a wisdom and a forebearance that allows a person to control their anger. Hilm is an intelligence that, in our terms, allows someone to control their anger, even if their anger is justified. It allows you to, when you are justifiably angry, to control it and not manifest it.</description>

      <description>We hear this phrase thrown around a lot these days&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;ahlul sunnah wal jam&amp;#8217;aah&amp;#8221; (literally, &amp;#8220;the people of the sunnah and the jam&amp;#8217;ah/group&amp;#8221;). But what does it really mean, and who are the people who are TRULY ahlul sunnah wal jam&amp;#8217;aah?
To find out the answer, we must ask those who defined those terms. Not your friendly neighborhood shaykh or imam; not your mom, your dad, your grandfather, or his grandfather; not even the tabi&amp;#8217;oon, or the companions.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;I guarantee a house in Jannah (Paradise) for one who gives up arguing, even if he is in the right; and I guarantee a house in the middle of Jannah for one who abandons lying even when joking / for the sake of fun; and I guarantee a house in the highest part of Jannah for one who has good manners.&amp;#8221; [Prophet Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم) &amp;#8211; reported by Imam Abu Dawud]</description>

      <description>In our last post, we looked at one of the dhikars taught to us by Rasulullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) We noted that by being smart, we can earn lots of hasanats much more quickly.
The dhikhar was:
  Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih, &amp;#8216;adada khalqihi, wa ridaa nafsihi, wazinata &amp;#8216;arshihi, wa midaada kalimaatihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of His words) [Shaheeh Muslim: Book 35, Number 6575]    When I first heard this hadith, I just loved it.</description>

      <description>Remember the story of the companion Umm Sulaym (رضي الله عنها), what an amazing thing about how a wife is with her husband. Her husband, Talha, was out working, and it so happened that day that their son, 10 years old, died.
She had a decision to make: when he comes home should she tell him right away, or should she just bear it and make him happy first and then when he is comfortable and settled in, then tell him?</description>

      <description>Safi Khan, in his &amp;#8220;Marriage 101&amp;#8243; lecture CD (available from here), mentions many points; of the best, he mentions the following:
 For Brothers: use extreme compassion and mercy towards your wives! Almost all relationships could benefit from more mercy and compassion. For Sisters: struggle not to complain! Once complaints start, they only get worse, and in the end, they can spoil your marriage. For Both: have a common goal&amp;#8211;to serve Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), to worship Him, and to enter Jannah together, without reckoning.</description>

      <description>With the Facebook craze that has struck us all in the past months, we have forgotten about a very serious matter that our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسل) talked about, and that matter being exposing of ones sins. We post messages on peoples walls, we post up pictures and what not, and its all exposing our sins to the public. We should be very cautious of the environment and inshallah try our best to protect our own dignity but also the dignity and respect of our brothers and sisters.</description>

      <description>Typ‧i‧cal: Conforming to a particular type. For someone to be &amp;#8220;typical&amp;#8221;, he/she would be one who conforms to his society and behaves much like his environment.
Typical in the 21st century: clubbing, flirting, sex, drugs, alcohol, stealing, cheating, swearing, injustice, premarital relations, immodesty, and the list goes on and on.
So who&amp;#8217;s typical? Is it the one who refrains from all the above, or the one indulges in it? Is it the one who&amp;#8217;s perceived weird when he speaks out against someone swearing?</description>

      <description>بَلَى مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ  Translation: Nay, but whoever submits his face (himself) to Allah and he is a Muhsin then his reward is with his Lord (Allah), on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. [Suratul Baqarah, verse 112]
1. Submit to Allah = fulfill the faraidh and abandon the haram
2. Be a Muhsin = do ibadah as if you see Allah, treat parents outstandingly, fulfill the rights of others outstandingly…basically, do good at every opportunity and whatever you do, try to be outstanding in it.</description>

      <description>Of Allah&amp;#8217;s greatest names is Al-Ghafuwr (الغَفُور). It&amp;#8217;s one of the most common names mentioned in the Qur&amp;#8217;an (91 times). The name itself is on the pattern that denotes a very powerful doer of an action.
Linguistic Meaning: The root of Al-Ghaffuwr and Al-Ghaffar is the verb is ghafara (غَفَرَ), which does NOT mean &amp;#8220;to forgive&amp;#8221;; rather, it means to shield and protect and cover. Like a helmet, which, in Arabic, is called a &amp;#8220;mighfaar.</description>

Allah. The name conjures up many associations&amp;#8211;the Creator, the Sustainer, the only one to be worshipped. The All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing. Ar-Rahmaan, Ar-Raheem.
But who is Allah? Do we really know Allah (سبحانه وتعال), in all His majesty and glory and might and mercy? Or&amp;#8211;like so many of the Muslims today&amp;#8211;do we only claim to know Allah, while in fact, we know almost nothing about Him&amp;#8211;the one who sent the Prophets as a mercy to us, who created us for nothing but His worship, out of His mercy!</description>

What, then, are some of the etiquettes of eating?
&amp;#8216;Umar bin Abu Salamah (رضي الله عنه) reported: Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم), said to me, &amp;#8220;Mention Allah&amp;#8217;s Name (i.e., say Bismillah before you start eating), eat with your right hand, and eat from what is near you.</description>

The army had a lost-and-found guy&amp;#8211;Sawfan ibn Mu&amp;#8217;atib (رضالله عنه)&amp;#8211;who travelled behind the army and picked up lost items. So when he saw her, he immediately said la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (there is no might or power except Allah), hopped off his camel, and let her go on it.</description>

The answer is, you put it through a test.
أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوا أَن يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ
وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَاذِبِينَ  Translation: Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &amp;#8220;We believe,&amp;#8221; and will not be tested?</description>

      <description>Whether you travel by foot or by bike, by bus or by car, by train or by plane, you should recite the du&amp;#8217;a the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us &amp;#8212; because du&amp;#8217;as are always for our protection.
This du&amp;#8217;a, in particular, comes in handy these days, since so many people have to commute to school or work.
Allah says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
لِتَسْتَوُوا عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُوا سُبْحانَ الَّذِي سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</description>

      <description>Space: a black, velvety landscape. It stretches infinitely in every direction, a perfect paradox, an unconquered unknown. Stars, hundreds of thousands of stars—their light usually dimmed by the effects of pollution, electric lights, and daylight—glimmer like a quilt of fireflies, shimmering and twinkling.
Even the space itself shimmers and dances with colour—here, a blue nebulae with ghostly-transparent particles. There, a shimmering cascade of yellows and browns and pinks and reds that dance and weave their way through space.</description>

The norm during those days was that when a land is conquered, ALL its people are killed, and its women and children are taken as slaves and property. So when the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) conquered Mecca, the Meccans became frightened.</description>

Abu Hurayrah (رضالله عنه) reported that Allah&amp;#8217;s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;When a human being dies, all of his deeds are TERMINATED, except for three types:
 An ongoing charity (aka sadaqah jariyah)
 A knowledge (of Islam) from which others benefit,</description>

      <description>During the 23 years of revelation, the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had many supporters and opponents, including his two uncles&amp;#8211;Abu Talib (the father of Ali (رضالله عنه)), and Abdul &amp;#8216;Uzza ibn Abdul-Muttalib, aka Abu Lahab.
Subhanallah, even within two uncles of the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم), we see great differences. Compare and constrast them:
Abu Talib:
 Extended his protection to his nephew, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), even though the Quresh wanted to kill him Wrote strong, emotional poetry during the boycott of Mecca in order to move people towards nullifying it Commanded his sons to sleep in the Prophet&amp;#8217;s (صلي الله عليه وسلم) bed at night, so that if any assassins came, the sons would die instead of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said regarding him: because of me, he will be in the lightest part of the Hellfire.</description>

      <description>Many years ago in Uzbekistan, a baby boy was born blind. His Mother, the strong mu&amp;#8217;minah that she was, did not lose sight of He who had the Power to cure him. She prayed and prayed for her son&amp;#8217;s sight. And within a few years, the boy regained his eyes.
She was widowed, the boy orphaned. She traveled with him to Makkah so that he could receive an Islamic education. She arranged for him to attend the circles of the scholars, and in those circles, he excelled in the science of hadith.</description>

Knowledge and Studying your Deen  &amp;#8220;I am here in front of you today, and if I were to choose again, I would go back and do the same thing and do religious studies. I can&amp;#8217;t even remember what courses I took when I was at UH. My main motivation for choosing to do Islamic studies was that I realized I needed to do something for the ummah.</description>

      <description>Umar Ibn Hubayra Al-Fazari was the governor of Iraq in the period of the Khilafa of Yazid Ibn Abdul-Malik of the Bani Umayyah. Hassan Ibn Yasar Al-Basri once came to the court of Umar Ibn Hubayra and said to him:
&amp;#8220;O Ibn Hubayra! Fear Allah when you obey Yazid, and do not fear Yazid when you obey Allah. Know that Allah will protect you from Yazid, but Yazid can not protect you from Allah (سبحانه وتعال)</description>

      <description>Some points to ponder about Salah, Namaz, Prayer&amp;#8230;
Our purpose in life is to worship Allah. Prayer (Salah) is the manifestation of that. Without it, we have nothing.
Prayer:
 Is the only commandment in Islam that came from Allah (سبحانه وتعال) to Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم) directly, without any angel in-between, in the journey of Isra Wal Miraj[1] Was originally legislated at 50 times per day (That just shows how important it is)[1] One of the last concerns of the dying Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)[2] Time after time, mentioned in the Quran as the first requirement right after Faith in Allah (سبحانه وتعال) [3] Quran described as guidance for the ones who pray (right at the beginning of the book in Surah Baqarah) [4] Agreement between us and the Prophet, without prayer, is kufr[5] A person&amp;#8217;s feet will not move on the Day of Judgement until he is questioned about the prayer.</description>

      <description>The hypocrisy of Western Modern culture is amazing! We need to realize that Islam began as something strange, and will end as something strange, so we need not worry what people think of us; rather, we need to be people that respect and fear Allah (سبحانه وتعال), and the creation of Allah (the people) come second.
Legal marriage age is 16? 18? but:
It&amp;#8217;s okay for 14-year-old teens to have sex , and their parents having no idea about it, and it&amp;#8217;s with someone they may not approve of, and the person may not have their son or daughter&amp;#8217;s best interest at heart.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/sincerity-and-conformity/</guid>
      <description>For any action to be accepted by Allah (سبحانه وتعال), it has to meet two requirements: sincerity and conformity. Sincerity means that the action must be done purely to earn the pleasure of Allah, and not for other reasons (such as &amp;#8220;because it&amp;#8217;s cool&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;because my friends are doing it&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;so the community will love me&amp;#8221;).
Conformity means that the action must be done in conformity with Shari&amp;#8217;ah, the Qur&amp;#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم).</description>

وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى
فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى

فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى
وَمَا يُغْنِي عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى
إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا لَلْهُدَى
وَإِنَّ لَنَا لَلْآخِرَةَ وَالْأُولَى  Translation: &amp;#8220;So for him who gives in charity, fears Allah, and testifies to goodness, We shall facilitate for him the Path of good. As for him who is stingy and considers himself independent of Allah and rejects the goodness, We shall facilitate for him the Path to evil.</description>

Most Muslims learn the Qur&amp;#8217;an starting with Juz &amp;#8216;Amma&amp;#8211;the shortest chapters of the Qur&amp;#8217;an. But, most of us also have no idea what these verses we recite&amp;#8211;day after day, and prayer after prayer, for many of us&amp;#8211;actually mean, and what lessons they impart.
Touched by an Angel: Tafeer Juz &amp;#8216;Amma cures that, by giving Muslims what each and every one of us desires: understanding of the Qur&amp;#8217;an.</description>

 A place for children: not a place where they cried and ran around but a place where they were accommodated. There are several narrations of how when the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was praying, the children would come and climb on his back or he (صلي الله عليه وسلم) would hold them while praying salah.</description>

      <description>Human Nature is Insatiable  Human nature is insatiable. No matter how much you get, you will never be happy with it. That is the way we have been created. The key to happiness is not to get it all, but rather, to be content with little.
&amp;#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from incapacity, from sloth, from cowardice, from miserliness, from decrepitude, and from the torment of the grave.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه), the second khalifa, had four beliefs that made it easier for him to bear calamities:
 The situation could have been worse. It didn’t strike him in his religion. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will reward him with Jannah in return inshallah. When he remembered the hardship of losing the Prophet(صلي الله عليه وسلم) everything else faded away.  Subhanallah, these are profound beliefs from the second khalifa that we can all benefit from!</description>

      <title>Kaana as Emphasis</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2007/kaana-as-emphasis/</guid>
      <description>The word kaana is the past-tense masculine singular third-person (he) form of the verb to-be. So you can translate it as &amp;#8220;he was&amp;#8221;. (And the khabr takes the same rules as with any other verb.)
So what does it mean when Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) uses kaana to describe Himself? For example, in surah Nisaa, He says:
إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً  Translation: And seek the Forgiveness of Allah; surely, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful [Surah Nisaa, 4:106]</description>

      <description>The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said to his cousin: &amp;#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and ease with hardship. 1
Even in the battle of Qadisiyyah, after fighting through the whole day, the Muslim leader said &amp;#8220;just be patient, and keep fighting.&amp;#8221; Even into the night, when most armies stop fighting at night! But subhanallah, what happened? By the next morning, the Muslims had won.</description>

إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً  Translation: So verily, with the hardship, there is relief; Verily, with the hardship, there is relief! [Surah Ash-Shrah, verses 5-6]
Two for the price of one! How&amp;#8217;s that for a deal?
So if you find yourself in a position of hardship, ask yourself: What ease am I forgetting?
And also, the use of with, shows that the two are so closely related as to be companions&amp;#8211;they are together!</description>

      <description>Allah says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
الْحَمْدُ للّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ الرَّحْمـنِ الرَّحِيمِ
مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ  You might ask, why do rabb, Ar-Rahmaan, Ar-Raheem, and Maalik all have kasra on them? Why not dumma (the default), or fatha?
The answer is that, wallahu &amp;#8216;alim, they are na&amp;#8217;at (adjactives) for Allah&amp;#8211;words that describe His greatness.
For example, Ar-Rahmaan means &amp;#8220;the source of mercy&amp;#8221; (that&amp;#8217;s why, scholars say, you cannot name your son Rahman).</description>

 “There are seven whom Allah will shade in His Shade on the Day when there is no shade except His Shade:
 a just ruler; a youth who grew up in the worship of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic; a man whose heart is attached to the mosques; two men who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for that and parting upon that; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position [for illegal intercourse], but be says: ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in charity and hides it, such that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity; and a man who remembered Allah in private and so his eyes shed tears.</description>

      <description>In the fast-paced world we live in, we often lose the righteousness needed to attain the closeness to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) that we desire. We go through constant struggles, fighting with ourselves to do what is good and to stay on The Straight Path. At times we prosper and succeed, but much of the time, we lose the fight, but why? Why do we succumb to the temptations of this world?</description>

Driving home from work after having a late staff meeting, it was an ordinary evening not much traffic on the road.

      <description>Attaining Jannah can be easy if we want it to be. The choice is ours to make. Just take a step towards Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and watch!
To make things easy, it is reported that Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: “Whoever recites Ayatul-Kursi immediately after each prescribed prayer, there will be nothing standing between him and his entering Paradise except death.” (Reported by An-Nasa’i and Ibn Hibban)</description>

      <description>So, do you want to enter Jannah? Think about it for a second.
OK, that was an easy one. Here&amp;#8217;s a more difficult question, how do you plan on getting there? Take your time and think about that one.
That thinking in and of itself will help you get to Jannah, inshallah ta&amp;#8217;ala.
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will make the path easier for those who sincerely desire to come closer to Him and find ways to do so.</description>

 Alhamdulillah for the fact that Allah gave us the ability to thank and praise Him, yet we could never thank Him enough for what He gave us.</description>

We may buy a new car but end up doing it to raise our status in society or for pride. At the same time though, we may buy a car and do it solely for Allah&amp;#8217;s cause, and in this there is good. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
&amp;#8220;So whomsoever does good equal to the wieght of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it.</description>

The hadith clearly states that the Rasool of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) can be seen in a dream, as Satan (may Allah&amp;#8217;s curse be upon him) cannot take his form. However, some points which should be noted concerning its meaning are as follows:</description>

      <description>To continue our series of ways to purify our salaah, a very important aspect is to take some time and to actually reflect and think about the ayaat being recited.
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
(This is) a Book (the Qur&amp;#8217;an) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.”

&amp;#8211; Surah Hashr V.19 A very powerful ayah in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, very powerful indeed for those who ponder and reflect upon the words of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). This one ayah speaks to many amongst our ummah in this day and age at the same time shows us the results of their doings.</description>

      <description>Once, a women came to Abu Hanifa (رحمالله) to sell a silk garment. Abu Hanifa asked &amp;#8221; How much is it?&amp;#8221; She replied, &amp;#8220;one hundred.&amp;#8221; He said, &amp;#8220;It is worth more than a hundred. How much?&amp;#8221;
So the woman increased the price by hundred, and again, and when it reached four hundred, Abu Hanifa said, &amp;#8220;It should be more than that.&amp;#8221; The woman said, &amp;#8221; you are mocking me.&amp;#8221;
So, Abu Hanifa said, &amp;#8220;bring a man to value it.</description>

      <description>How do we attain money, power, and respect?
The path is easy, you follow the way of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) and the commands of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), then inshallah you will attain the money, the power, and the respect. Now it is up to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) whether He blesses you with such things. However, with sincerity in your actions, the chances are high.
The overlying goal is to keep Islam in your heart; thrive for it, live to please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), do all your actions in accordance to the sunnah, and follow the commands of The Al-Mighty, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).</description>

      <description>Are you a student, or working? Are you depressed or frustrated that you could not take the advantage of the last ten nights of Ramadan? There were midterms, assignments, and projects for all the working folk, all those cliched reasons, or maybe you did take advantage. Here is another chance. Its on our doorsteps, the most beloved days to Allah, the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah.
It was reported by Ibn ‘Abbas (رضي الله عنه) that the Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.</description>

      <description>How does it feel after reading Qur&amp;#8217;an? Does it make a difference in us? How much do we implement it regularly, or even within the same day of reading an ayah?
When learning from the Qur&amp;#8217;an and the seerah of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), Allah mentions a believers qualities in the Qur&amp;#8217;an. The believers hearts become fearful and their eyes tear. This is a sign of the true believers, as Allah describes them in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:</description>

      <description>Many of us desire to be among those who pray Qiyam al-Layl (or Tahajjud), but find it difficult to wake up in the middle of the night for it. What can we do to make this easier?
Option 1: Late Sleepers. If you happen to be one of those late-night people&amp;#8211;whether you&amp;#8217;re up late studying for exams, chilling, or working on a project&amp;#8211;why not make wudoo and pray two rakahs before you sleep?</description>

      <description>Remember that the outcome of our actions are in the Will of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and nothing else. Our efforts do not convey a certainty towards the outcome whatsoever. There are times where you study, study, study for a test and only score a 60. Then there are times you may just briefly glance over your notes the night before and score an 80.
Is it by luck?
No.
This shows that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is The One in control.</description>

      <description>Continuing in our series of ways to attain purification in salaah: Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur’an:
وَرَتِّلِ الْقُرْآنَ تَرْتِيلاً  “&amp;#8230; and recite the Qur’an in slow, measured rhythmic tones” (Surah al-Muzammil 73:4)
From this alone, we see the importance of reciting the Qur’an in a proper manner–slowly and with a rythmic tone–and not just whizzing through it as if we were reading a magazine of some sort. Also, our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had a recitation which was clear, with each letter proncounced distinctly (Ahmad, 6&amp;frasl;294, saheeh).</description>

      <description>A lot of Muslims, in their great love for the Ka&amp;#8217;bah (which is an admiral thing), make some mistakes because of their lack of understanding about barakah. We already mentioned that the Ka&amp;#8217;bah is one of the places that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) put barakah&amp;#8211;but what does that mean?
As a reminder, only Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) decides what things contain barakah, and what things give barakah, because all barakah is from Him.</description>

      <description>After years of dawah the people of Nuh (عليه سلام), Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) revealed to Nuh (عليه سلام) (interpretation of the meaning) &amp;#8220;None of thy people will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their (evil) deeds.&amp;#8221; (Surah Hud, verse 35)
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) instructed Nuh (عليه سلام) to build an ark, and that the sinners will drown in a flood. As Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) states in Qur&amp;#8217;an (to the interpretation of the meaning): &amp;#8220;But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood).</description>

      <description>One of the diseases we experience in our culture is cheap talk. People say things all the time, whether they mean it or not. Worse, people lie as easily as they breathe&amp;#8211;sometimes, even as often&amp;#8211;and sometimes, under the guise of &amp;#8220;just kidding!&amp;#8221;
But is talk cheap? Let&amp;#8217;s look at some evidence from the Qur&amp;#8217;an and Sunnah.
 Shahada: People enter Islam when they take the shahada&amp;#8211;in other words, when they say certain words.</description>

      <description>Once a young man from the Muhajiruwn and a young man from the Ansaar quarreled. So the muhajirun called out for help stating: &amp;#8220;O Muhajiruwn!&amp;#8221; And the ansaari said: &amp;#8220;O Ansaar!&amp;#8221; The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) heard this and said: &amp;#8221;Is it with the call off jahiliyyah that you are calling out, and I am present amongst you!&amp;#8221; (Bukhari)
Allah loves Muhajiruwn and Ansaar. Allah states (interpretation of the meaning) : &amp;#8220;And [those Allah grants mercy on includes] the first to embrace Islam from the Muhajiruwn and the Ansaar, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions.</description>

Love of Allah  Ibn al-Qaiyim (رحمالله) mentioned ten causes that result in Allah&amp;#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) love for His slave and the slave&amp;#8217;s love for his Lord. [These ten are:]
First, recite the Qur&amp;#8217;an while pondering over its meanings and what is meant by it.</description>

      <description>This is the fourth part of our discussion on ways to achieving purification of our salaah.
The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said: ‘I have divided the prayer between Myself and My slave, into two halves, and My slave shall have what he has asked for.&amp;#8217;
&amp;#8220;When the slave says &amp;#8220;Ar-Rehman-nir-Raheem&amp;#8220;, Allaah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, &amp;#8220;My slave has extolled me.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;When the slave says, &amp;#8220;Malikee Yawma Ddin&amp;#8220;, Allaah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, &amp;#8220;My slave has glorified me&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;My servant has related all matters to Me.</description>

      <title>The Meaning of Du’a</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/the-meaning-of-dua/</guid>
      <description>The word &amp;#8220;du&amp;#8217;a&amp;#8221; is the verbal noun of the verb &amp;#8220;da&amp;#8217;a&amp;#8221;, which means &amp;#8220;to call out, to summon.&amp;#8221;
With that said, du&amp;#8217;a is a fundamental aspect of Islam, and without it, one&amp;#8217;s eman cannot be intact. Allah mentions du&amp;#8217;a in the Qur&amp;#8217;an to signify many things, such as:
 Worship: وَلاَ تَدْعُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنْفَعُكَ وَلاَ يَضُرُّكَ 
Translation: &amp;#8220;And do not call besides Allah that which will not harm you or benefit you&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; [Surah Yunus, 10:106].</description>

      <description>The following is an excerpt from &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t be Sad&amp;#8221; by Shaykh Aaidh ibn Abdullah Al-Qarni.
Extract the Honey, but do not break the Hive  Everything that has gentleness within it is beautified, and whatever lacks it is spoiled. When you meet someone, giving them a bright smile and a kind word, you are displaying a characteristic of the truly successful person, a characteristic that even a bee exhibits. When a bee lands on a flower (doing so for a practical purpose) it does not destroy it, because Allah rewards gentleness with that which He does give for harshness.</description>

      <description>Inshallah what follows is a small gem from the Qur&amp;#8217;an about Maryam (عليها سلام), mother of &amp;#8216;Isa (عليه سلام).
At the end of Surah Tahrim, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
وَمَرْيَمَ ابْنَتَ عِمْرَانَ الَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِنَا وَصَدَّقَتْ بِكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّهَا وَكُتُبِهِ وَكَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتِينَ  Translation: And Mary the daughter of &amp;#8216;Imran, who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into (her body) of Our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord and of His Revelations, and was one of the Qanitiyn [Surah Tahrim, 66:12]</description>

And mankind, with regard to their performance of prayer are in five levels:
The First: The level of the one who is negligent and wrongs his soul: He is the one who falls short in performing wudoo properly, performing the prayer upon its time and within its specified limits, and in fulfilling its essential pillars.
The Second: The one who guards his prayers upon their proper times and within their specified limits, fulfills their essential pillars and performs his wudoo with care.</description>

He chills with his friends. And if she&amp;#8217;s not mad, maybe he&amp;#8217;ll call his girlfriend for a date. Just your ordinary homeboy or girl.</description>

      <description>It rained today. And rained. And rained. And as I walked through the rain, I noticed three distinct types of ground: pavement, grass, and flooded grass.
As rain falls on the pavement, it streams off, making the surface slick and slippery, or else pools. Drainage systems handle large amounts of water, but those have their own cost. As for pools, what do they do? They erode away slowly at the pavement.</description>

Our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) used to move at a measured pace throughout his salaah; so much so that he would allow every bone to return to its place after each movement (classified saheeh by Ibn Kuzaymah and al-Hafiz).</description>

Inshallah here, we&amp;#8217;ll do a brief (grammatical) dissection of the phrase, so you can understand the words better (and not mix them up / mispronounce them). If you hover your mouse over underlined words, you&amp;#8217;ll see the Arabic inshallah.
Inna: Inna is really inna-na. The first part is &amp;#8220;very&amp;#8221;, the last part is &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;but Arabs like to simplify, so they just write it as inna (with only two noons).</description>

      <description>Continuing our discussion of the purification of salaah, one of the primary ways to gain khushoo’ is to prepare ahead of time! Try these authentic actions from the sunnah:
 Perform wudoo properly; start with bismillah and end with ash-hadu an laa ilaaha illallah wahdahu laa sharee ka lahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan abdahu wa rasoolahu.
Umar bin Al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) narrated that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;Whoever of you performs wudoo thoroughly then says: &amp;#8216;I testify that there is no god but Allah, with Whom there is no associate, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger,&amp;#8217; the eight gates of Paradise will be opened to him to enter from whichever he wants.</description>

      <description>Ok, so you parents have rights upon you while they live. Most of us know that. What about after they&amp;#8217;ve left this life? Is it possible they might still have some rights due from you?
The answer is a resounding yes! Their rights, after they die, are:
 Janaazah: That you (or someone in the community) washes their body, buries them, etc., and you pray their janaazah prayer with the community.</description>

      <description>We’ve all been there…You’re just chillin’, chatting on MSN with your buddies, and then you take a look at the time. Its 12:13am and you still haven’t prayed Isha. O mannn! You get off MSN, go make wudoo, and then perform your prayer. However, as we all know, our laziness and tired state takes over us, and this reflects in our prayer.
You finish praying at 12:17am and you find yourself in the same position you were no more than five mins ago, on MSN.</description>

The lesson itself is very simple, but realizing the importance and understanding the implications it may have in one’s life is what matters the most. The lesson is: you can‘t please everyone. Sounds so simple, right? Many of us are reading this and saying, well duh! So then, if its so obvious why do we keep persisting in our efforts to doing so?</description>

So perform these activities regularly, and with ihsaan! Inshallah in the coming days, we will expound and narrate some instances where Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), or His messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم), promised paradise &amp;#8212; keys that we can use to unlock the doors and, inshallah, enter!</description>

However, when it creeps up into your own country, your own city, your own community, your own _family_–you feel everything.</description>

Many of us, or our parents, invest a good amount of income towards this so-called &amp;#8220;educational system&amp;#8221; entitled “University” or “College”. Many of us invest hours upon hours, days upon days, week after week indulged in books and lectures learning about Limits, Laws of Neutrality, Psychological Human Behaviour, or, my favourite, Pareto Optimal (:S).</description>

      <description>Truth is one and falsehood is many. How do we know? Just look at the Qur&amp;#8217;an! Allah makes a simile of truth as a singular light (noor), and falsehood as a plural of darkness (dhulumaat &amp;#8212; multiple).
What&amp;#8217;s more, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) once drew a stick in the dirt and said &amp;#8220;this is the Straight Path.&amp;#8221; He then drew lines that grew away from it, left and right, and said &amp;#8220;these are the paths of misguidance, and at the top of every one of these paths is a devil calling the people.</description>

      <title>Emphasis in the Qur’an</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/emphasis-in-the-quran/</guid>
      <description>Why is emphasis important? It proves truthfulness. For example, if you says &amp;#8220;Khalid stopped by today&amp;#8221; and your friend says &amp;#8220;Khalid didn&amp;#8217;t stop by today,&amp;#8221; and you say &amp;#8220;I swear by Allah that he stopped by today,&amp;#8221; that proves your truthfulness.
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) doesn&amp;#8217;t need any emphasis&amp;#8211;what He says is always true! Yet He still emphasizes. Whenever He emphasizes something, pay close attention, and realize that what He says immediately afterward is very important.</description>

      <description>Taqwa: To be aware of Allah. To obey him and do those things that earn His pleasure and mercy, and avoid disobeying him and doing those things that earn His punishment and wrath.
Ali ibn Abu Talib (رضي الله عنه), fourth khalifa of Islam and amazing companion of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), said: Taqwa is three things:
 To fear Allah, the almighty. To follow the revelation (i.e. the Qur&amp;#8217;an and the Sunnah).</description>

      <description>Now that Ramadan&amp;#8217;s over, many of us feel sad&amp;#8211;we miss the spirituality, the eman rush, the amazing strength that we all demonstrate in Ramadan. So what can you do to bring those feelings back?
One thing is to keep performing the deeds you performed in Ramadan&amp;#8211;and this is one of the signs that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) accepted your deeds.
Another act you can perform is to fast six days of Shawwal, the month right after Ramadan.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/tafseer-ibn-abbas/</guid>
      <description>Abdullah ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) was a great companion and a great scholar. In fact, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) made du&amp;#8217;a for him, that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grants him knowledge of the deen.
Even more amazing then this, Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) once made du&amp;#8217;a and said, &amp;#8220;O Allah! teach him wisdom (i.e. the understanding of the knowledge of Qur&amp;#8217;an).&amp;#8221; [Bukhari 5/57/100] This is why his tafseer carries a heavy weight, even today, more then a millenium after his death.</description>

      <description>As Ramadan comes to a close and the remaining few days fly over our heads, many of us wonder at where it disappeared. We dust off our Qur&amp;#8217;ans and gun our engines to catch salaah at the masjid&amp;#8211;Taraweeh, Qiyam al-Layl, or just the daily five.
All of us acquire a certain sensitivity to time. Suddenly, every day, every hour counts. We think twice about spending two hours here or half an hour there on things we normally just do.</description>

      <description>Just like we have different starting dates for Ramadan, we have different Eid dates.
And you know what? That&amp;#8217;s ok. Why? Because it&amp;#8217;s all based on legitimate difference of opinion. Not some beardy guy making stuff up because he feels like it.
So when &amp;#8216;Eid rolls around, enjoy it, and don&amp;#8217;t hate on other people for when they celebrate. That&amp;#8217;s messed up.
By the way&amp;#8211;when &amp;#8216;Eid rolls around, remember this: you just fasted for 30 days straight, give or take a day.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/the-purpose-of-fasting/</guid>
      <description>One of the verses of the Qur&amp;#8217;an we hear all the time in the context of fasting is this one:
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ  Translation: O you who believe! Allah prescribed fasting upon you, as it He prescribed for those before you, that you may attain taqwa (piety, God-consciousness). [Al-Baqarah, 2:183]
Those last two words summarize the entire purpose of fasting: to attain taqwa.</description>

While you can understand these from different angles, we explain these from an Usool-ul-Fiqh perspective. Here they are:
    Fard/Wajib (obligatory) means any action that you earn a reward for performing, and earn a punishment from abstaining from. Examples include praying, fasting, etc.
Mustahab/Sunnah (recommended) means any action that you earn a reward for performing, and earn nothing from abstaining from.</description>

      <description>Ramadan is the month of Qur&amp;#8217;an. A month where many of us fast, pray Taraweeh, pray Qiyam al-Layl, and read the entire Qur&amp;#8217;an&amp;#8211;maybe more then once!
But subhanallah, in our love for Ramadan and our zeal for good deeds, we sometimes aim to accomplish more then our human capacity. We&amp;#8217;re humans, we all have limits.
But people say &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to read the WHOLE QUR&amp;#8217;AN this time!&amp;#8221; when they can&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8211;sometimes, even reading only one juz, maybe even the last juz, is an accomplishment for them, one within their ability.</description>

      <description>The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us five favourable (mustahab or &amp;#8220;sunnah&amp;#8221;) actions for us to follow while fasting. These are:
 Hasten Iftaar: When Maghrib time arrives, hasten to break your fast&amp;#8211;do not delay. It&amp;#8217;s said that he, (صلي الله عليه وسلم), sent Bilal (رضي الله عنه) to stand on top of a high-up hill to see when the sun set, then broke his fast immediately. Eat Suhoor: A lot of cultures teach us to skip suhoor and start fasting when we sleep.</description>

      <description>A Muhaddith is one who studies and memorizes ahadith, and internalizes the science of hadith&amp;#8211;the science that allows us to dissect and analyze ahadith and sort the authentic from the un-authentic. (You can read more about ahadith and their statuses here.) This includes memorizing the biographies of people involved in the narration, including their strengths and weaknesses (in terms of memory and piety).
Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-ud-Deen al-Albani, one of the greatest scholars of recent times, also studied ahadith and became a muhaddith&amp;#8211;one the likes of we have not seen in centuries.</description>

      <description>Whenever Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) mentions the Fire, He (سبحانه وتعالى) always mentions a fire exit&amp;#8211;usually immediately afterwards. There&amp;#8217;s always a chance to escape. But once you die, there&amp;#8217;s no fire exit. For example, in Surah Baqarah, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ  وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِين آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَار  Translation: But if you cannot&amp;#8211;and you can never do it&amp;#8211;then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and the stones, prepared for the Unbelievers.</description>

Verse addressed to Banu Israeel (Jews)? Maybe Ahlil Kitaab (people of the book)? Or maybe An-Naas (humankind)? Or even the obvious, to those who believed? Yes, it addresses them&amp;#8211;but it also addresses you.

      <description>In Surah Fatiha, Allah Almighty says:
غَيرِ المَغضُوبِ عَلَيهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّالِّينَ  Translation: Not of those who earned your anger, nor of those astray.
From this verse, scholars mention that we identify three levels of practice.
First, there are those who don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8211;they don&amp;#8217;t know about Islam. They don&amp;#8217;t know about the truth. Or they don&amp;#8217;t know enough&amp;#8211;for example, how to pay zakaah. These are the ones mentioned as gone astray (الضَّالِّينَ).</description>

      <description>Ramadan kills all the excuses we make for ourselves throughout the year, and allows us to soar to new heights of eman! If someone said to you, &amp;#8220;let&amp;#8217;s go to the masjid every day,&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;d say &amp;#8220;we can&amp;#8217;t do it!&amp;#8221; but, in Ramdan, you do it! If someone said &amp;#8220;let&amp;#8217;s play Qiyam al-Layl all night,&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;d say &amp;#8220;we can&amp;#8217;t do it!&amp;#8221; but, in Ramdan, you do it! Subhanallah, in Ramdan, wishes and hopes and dreams can become reality!</description>

      <description>In many countries (mostly Western countries&amp;#8211;America, Canada, Europe, etc.) our communities fight over the actual start date of Ramadan. This, itself, is not so bad&amp;#8211;because, alhamdulillah, everyone backs up their opinion with a legitimate fiqh source (more on that in a second). However, the problem is that people in the same region fast on different days&amp;#8211;sometimes, even two people in the same house fast on different days!
So how do we go about picking an appropriate date to start fasting?</description>

      <description>For those who live in Western societies, fitnah abounds. From the moment you leave your house (or even before that), it bombards you from all sides, whether you&amp;#8217;re a man or a woman. How can we lower our gaze under these distressing conditions?
The following tactics will benefit you inshallah if you apply them consistently.

      <description>Another important gem we learn from the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) and the early generations is that power comes with conciseness.
During the time of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), he received a letter from a man named Musaylimah, who claimed prophethood as well, and wished to divide up the area. In response, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) wrote:

      <description>During the battle of Yarmuk, Az-Zubayr (رضي الله عنه) tried to incite the mujahideen to fight against the Romans. (You can read the entire incident here.)
From this incident, we learn some important leadership lessons:
 When nobody steps up to the task, the leader must take the initiative to get the job done. Because, one way or another, the task must be completed. Leaders also work in the trenches, when circumstances require it of them.</description>

      <description>What exactly is a hadith? It&amp;#8217;s a saying of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). The Science of Hadith defines a hadeeth as &amp;#8220;whatever is attributed to the Prophet, in terms of sayings, actions, approvals, and physical and character descriptions.&amp;#8221; 1
Ahadith are an important part of Islam. They complement and the Qur&amp;#8217;an, and provide us with numerous benefits and different types of information, including:

      <description>The Muslims were forced out of their land because of the persecution of the polytheist Arabs, who tortured them because they said, &amp;#8220;our Lord is one&amp;#8221;. The Prophet Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم) commanded the Muslims to migrate to Abysynnia, to live under the Negus, a just ruler. The Polytheists refused to let them leave peacefully, and confronted the king to demand the return of the Muslims. Jafar was chosen as the spokesperson for the Muslims to the king.</description>

      <description>Every specific Islamic rule originates from a law maker. Here, we investigate who can say, in Islam, that something is the law.
Allah is the Law Maker!  Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), Lord of the Worlds, is the law maker. None can dispute His laws. What&amp;#8217;s the proof? In Surah Yusuf Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ لِلّهِ أَمَرَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ ذَلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  Translation: the command is for none but Allah: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right deen, but most men understand not.</description>

      <description>Last month before summer ends, we let the days go by or wrap up summer courses before it all starts over again! To get that degree, we consistently keep up with projects, homework, study for tests, etc. And sure enough, most of us accomplish this &amp;#8216;goal&amp;#8217; within the time we aimed for.
But do we have similar goals for learning the deen? It might be something we admired&amp;#8211;and perhaps desired&amp;#8211;but never really worked for.</description>

      <description>The following is an explaination on zakaah as it applies to business. In short, it&amp;#8217;s 2.5% of marketable items.
Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub: The Mesenger of Allah used to order us to pay the sadaqah (zakaah) on what (goods) we prepared for trade. [Abu Dawud 9&amp;frasl;1557]1
&amp;#8220;Goods from what we prepared for trade&amp;#8221; means business inventory. So if someone owns a clothing store full of leather jackets, they pay zakaah on all the jackets not sold after a year.</description>

      <title>Three Requirements of Zakaah</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/three-requirements-of-zakaah/</guid>
      <description>Zakaah is paid on assets&amp;#8211;things that bring in money. This is important, because it means zakaah is not on things you use&amp;#8211;like your only car, or your house. More on that next post inshallah ta&amp;#8217;ala.
There are three requirements before zakaah becomes due:
 Islam: The person has to be Muslim. (Non-Muslims don&amp;#8217;t pay zakaah.) We deduce this from the hadith of Mu&amp;#8217;ad ibn Jabal (رضي الله عنه), who the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) sent to Yemen.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/amplify-your-dua-with-tawassul/</guid>
      <description>What is Tawassul? Linguistically, it means that which brings you closer to an object. The Arabic is tawassul (توسّل) or wasiylah (وسيلة). Islamically, it means any good deed that brings you closer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)&amp;#8211;so every single good deed can be called tawassul&amp;#8211;though scholars use it specifically to mean things that increase our chances of having our du&amp;#8217;a accepted.
The Qur&amp;#8217;an and Sunnah only sanction four types of tawassal (with a difference of opinion on the fifth).</description>

      <description>Now that you know what barakah is, you might ask, how can one increase the barakah in his or her life? Aside from visiting the places with barakah, and making use of times with barakah, what else can you do?
The answer is very simple. If you want Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to bless you, then do anything for the sake of Allah, upon the sunnah (methodology) of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم).</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/shirk-the-destroyer/</guid>
      <description>Most of the ayat in the Qur&amp;#8217;an that are directed to non-Muslims, are directed to mushrikeen&amp;#8211;those who commit shirk. In fact, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) spells out, in painful detail, just how dangerous shirk is. Read and remember.
The Unforgivable Sin  Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, in Surah Nisaa:
إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا  Translation: Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/sins-tawbah-and-repetition/</guid>
      <description>Scholars say: there are no major sins with tawbah, and there are no minor sins with repetiton. What does that mean? The one who commits major sins and performs tawbah is forgiven; and the one who commits minor sins repeatedly is overcome by them, and they reach the level of major sins.
Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ud (رضي الله عنه) said: A believer treats a sin as if it is a mountain over his head that may fall on him any moment; whereas a dissolute person looks at it as a fly that hovers around his nose and he waves it away with his hand.</description>

      <description>In many places in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) makes this statement:
لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُون  Transliteration: Laa khawfun `alayhim wa laa hum yahzanuwn
Translation: No fear upon them and they will not grieve.
You can locate this in many ayat of the Quran, such as: Surah Baqarah verse 38, Surah al-An&amp;#8217;aam verse 48, and Surah Yunus verse 62, and others.
We&amp;#8217;ll break this statement into two parts inshaAllah: the first part, it deals with fear (laa khawfun `alayhim), and the second deals with grief (wa laa hum yuhzinuwn).</description>

      <description>In Surah Ibrahim, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) gives us the metaphor of the kalimah (la ilaha ilallah) as a beautiful tree. The verse is:
أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ اللّهُ مَثَلاً كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاء  Translation: Have you not seen how Allah has given the parable of a beautiful kalimah, like a beautiful tree, whose roots are firmly established, and whose branches tower in the sky?

Kindness to parents is pre-emptive&amp;#8211;it means you fulfill their needs before they ask. It&amp;#8217;s not antagonistic, where they ask and ask and ask until you give in and do what they say. It&amp;#8217;s not passive, where they have to tell you every little thing they need. It&amp;#8217;s active, so take the initiative and do what needs to be done, in order to earn the pleasure of Allah.</description>

      <description>Belief in Allah  Check this out. The mushrikeen, now and in the time of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), believed in Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Remember, these are the people who rejected Islam, and who are among the worst of people.
In Surah Ankabut, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ
[&amp;#8230;]
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَاء مَاء فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ  Translation: If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law), they will certainly reply, &amp;#8220;Allah&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Answerer: Shaykh Yasir Qadhi
Q: Allah grants knowledge to those He loves. What do you do to be among these people?  A: Strive. Show interest in the deen. Come closer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and He will come closer to you. There is a hadith on how to gain knowledge: &amp;#8216;ilm is only gained by studying. It&amp;#8217;s not gained by hiding in a cave and worshipping Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Studious study is the only way to gain knowledge.</description>

      <description>Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah can be roughly translated as &amp;#8220;Unity/Oneness of Lordship&amp;#8221;. It pertains to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and His lordship.
Definition  Rububiyyah is from rabb (ربّ), which has three linguistic meanings:
 Owner: The rabb is the true and complete owner. In one hadith, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &amp;#8220;if you find a camel in the desert, leave it till it meets its rabb (owner)&amp;#8221;. Obediance: The rabb is the one who is to be obeyed.</description>

      <description>The Qur&amp;#8217;an and sunnah both praise knowledge. There are many blessings of knowledge&amp;#8211;but first, we must define, &amp;#8220;what IS knowledge?&amp;#8221;
The Prophet said, in one hadith: &amp;#8220;If Allah wants to do a favor to somebody, He bestows on him, the gift of understanding the deen.&amp;#8221; [Bukhari 9/92/415]1 From this hadith, we know that knowledge, as defined in the Qur&amp;#8217;an and Sunnah, refers to knowledge of Islam, and not secular knowledge (such as Chemistry or Meteorology.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/on-patience/</guid>
      <description>Patience is active, not passive. What does this mean? It mains patience doesn&amp;#8217;t just &amp;#8220;happen&amp;#8221;. You must strive for it. You have to actively remind yourself and make yourself patient.
Also, remember that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) tests you with what you are not patient with. If He (سبحانه وتعالى) tested you with things you already succeed at, how could you ever learn and grow?
For a classic example of patience, consult Surah Yusuf.</description>

      <description>Continuing our discussion of barakah, you might ask &amp;#8220;so what has barakah in it?&amp;#8221;
 The Qur&amp;#8217;an: In many verses, the Qur&amp;#8217;an itself is called &amp;#8220;mubarak&amp;#8221;. There is nothing but good in it&amp;#8211;every letter, every verse, every surah, every prohibition, every command. The revelation, the recitation, the understanding, and the memorization, as well, are blessed&amp;#8211;because they are the speech of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). The Prophets: All prophets have barakah, especially the last, Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم).</description>

      <description>Tabaarak (تَبَارَك) has many meanings. The root word (ba-ra-kaf; like barakah) means:
 To Remain/Linger. This is why a pool of water is called birkah in Arabic. Same word. To Nurture/Generate. Connotations are that it increases.  Under Shari&amp;#8217;ah, the divine law of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), tabaarak means: the presence of divine blessings in an object, and an increase of those blessings. It also means: an increase in the amount of good in something.</description>

Answerer: Shaykh Yasir Qadhi
The single greatest way to increase your eman is to gain knowledge. Study what eman is, study tawhid, the pillars of eman, etc. It automatically increases your eman.
Good deeds also increase eman&amp;#8211;each and every single good deed and act of worship you perform increases your eman. Fast a day. Read Qur&amp;#8217;an. Pray Tahajjud.</description>

      <title>Three Aspects of Tawhid</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/three-aspects-of-tawhid/</guid>
      <description>Scholars of &amp;#8216;aqeeda divide tawhid into three aspects: tawhid ar-rububiyyah, tawhid al-uloohiyyah, and tawhid al-asmaa wal sifat.

      <description>&amp;#8216;Ibadah. We hear the word all the time. But what does it mean?
Linguistically, &amp;#8216;ibadah means to show subserviance, or to be subserviant to.
From a shar&amp;#8217;ee perspective, &amp;#8216;ibadah has two meanings:
 The spiritual conscience of the worshipper&amp;#8211;what constitutes worship spiritually. The actions&amp;#8211;what consitutes worship in action.  And Ibn Tamiyyah says: &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;Ibadah includes all hidden and shown actions, statements, and beliefs beloved to Allah.&amp;#8221;
Of actions, there are two types: natural and religious.</description>

      <title>Forgiveness for Shirk?</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/forgiveness-for-shirk/</guid>
      <description>Allah blessed me with the opportunity to listen to Shaykh Yasir Qadhi, who specializes in Aqeeda, speak about shirk. Here&amp;#8217;s what he said.
Question: What happens if you&amp;#8217;re Muslim and you&amp;#8217;ve committed shirk?
Answerer: Shaykh Yasir Qadhi
In the Qur&amp;#8217;an, in many places, Allah says shirk is unforgivable.
إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا  Translation: Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he devises indeed a great sin.</description>

      <description>In Surah Nisaa, Allah says:
وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَاء فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَاء حَتَّىَ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتَّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيًّا وَلاَ نَصِيرًا  Translation: They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike; therefore take not from among them friends until they forsake (their homes) in Allah&amp;#8217;s way; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper (Surah Nisaa, 4:89)1</description>

Do you wish to guide him whom Allah has caused to err? And whomsoever Allah causes to err, you shall by no means find a way for him.</description>

      <description>Eman has six pillars. To deny any one of the pillars, in part, or in whole, is the same as denying everything&amp;#8211;it takes you out of Islam, and may Allah protect us all from that.
The pillars are:
 Allah: Believe that Allah, Lord of the Worlds, exists, and believe in his asmaa wal sifa. Books: Believe in all the divine revelation, including the Torah, the Injeel, and the Qur&amp;#8217;an. They are really the same book (but now, the original Torah and Injeel no longer exist).</description>

The bucket leaks&amp;#8211;if you don&amp;#8217;t pour your time into buckets and use it effectively, most of it will end up spilled on the ground, lost.
Each day, you pass by some plants, and you have to stop and water them, or they die&amp;#8211;the big, thick bush of family.</description>

Allah takes careful account of all things (Surah Nisaa, 4:86)1
If your brother or sister in Islam gives you salaams, return it. So respond to &amp;#8220;as-salaamu &amp;#8216;alikum&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;wa&amp;#8217;alikum as-salaam wa rahmatullah&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;as-salaamu &amp;#8216;alikum wa rahmatullah&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;wa&amp;#8217;alikum as-salaam wa rahmatullah wa barakatuh&amp;#8221; (but don&amp;#8217;t go beyond that).</description>

It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment (Surah Nisaa, 4:84)1</description>

      <description>Salaah is the springboard of eman. Everytime you perform salaah, your eman should go up. In Surah Baqarah, Allah says: &amp;#8220;And seek help in patience and prayer. Indeed it is difficult, except for those with kushu&amp;#8220;.
Here are some tips inshaAllah to help you achieve awesome salaah:
 Pray as if it is your last prayer. We hear imams say this a lot. But what does it mean? How would your salaah be if you knew it was your last salaah before you returned to Allah, Lord of the Worlds?</description>

      <description>When you seek knowledge, seek from the best sources&amp;#8211;the most authentic, and those closest to the source. The companion Abdullah ibn Zubayr (رضي الله عنه) was 10 years old when the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) went on his farewell Hajj. Abdullah ibn Zubayr went, too, and witnessed the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam)&amp;#8217;s hajj first-hand.
After the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) passed away, Abdullah ibn Zubayr became the definitive source of the fiqh of Hajj&amp;#8211;starting at age 10&amp;#8211;until he passed away at 73.</description>

The message: prepare, and fight in groups.
A related incident: after the battle of Uhud, many tribes targeted the Muslims to take them down once and for all. The day the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) returned from battle, he slept, prayed &amp;#8216;Isha (alone), and the next day, after Fajr, said &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re going after [the fleeing army].</description>

Why not saw him in half? Because the boy&amp;#8217;s useful. He has influence among the poeple. People love him, and if he joins the king, many will follow his example.
So they took him up, and the boy said &amp;#8220;O Allah, suffice me against them in whatever way You please&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>We often make empty du&amp;#8217;as&amp;#8211;they lack in sincerity, but hey, we don&amp;#8217;t expect them to be answered. But why do it? Are you just testing Allah?
Think with certiny that Allah will answer your du&amp;#8217;a. Make the most sincere, heart-felt du&amp;#8217;a of your existance. And have hope that Allah will answer it. Before Islam, there was a man named Jurayj, a worshipper of Allah. The people around him had intense jealousy of him for this.</description>

      <title>The People of the Ditch (11): Torture and Flattery</title>

      <description>The king&amp;#8217;s companion pointed out the boy.
Why didn&amp;#8217;t he remain silent? For that matter, why does the boy point out the monk later?
Resolve. Ibn Tamiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said &amp;#8220;much of your resolve disappears when tortured&amp;#8221;. Your determination and strength of will plummets. So the man pointing out the boy, well, his determination couldn&amp;#8217;t withstand the torture.
So the king&amp;#8217;s soldiers brought the boy to the king, who said &amp;#8220;O my boy, your magic heals the blind and cures the lepers &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; Then he used flattery.</description>

      <description>The king&amp;#8217;s companion returned to the king. They knew he was cured&amp;#8211;previously, people had to help him find his way in, but now, he waltzed right in.
The king said: &amp;#8220;Who gave you back your sight?&amp;#8221;
His companion said: &amp;#8220;My Lord.&amp;#8221;
The king said: &amp;#8220;Do you have a Lord other then me?&amp;#8221;
His companion said: &amp;#8220;My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&amp;#8221;
So the king tortured him until he pointed out the boy.</description>

      <description>The boy healed the blind and the lepers&amp;#8211;the same miracles given to the prophet &amp;#8216;Isa (Jesus), on whom be peace.
Was he a prophet?
No, he was not.
The difference is: Allah gave the boy karamah, a less intense form of mu&amp;#8217;jizah. In a way, karamah mimics mu&amp;#8217;jizah, but to a less intense level.
The boy&amp;#8217;s powers mimiced the miracles of &amp;#8216;Isa (alayhi salaam), to a lesser level. And while &amp;#8216;Isa (alayhi salaam) could resurrect the dead, the boy could not.</description>

      <description>The boy used to heal the blind and the lepers and the people. (He wasn&amp;#8217;t a prophet: see the next post for more details.) The king&amp;#8217;s blind companion (jalees bin malik, or the one who sits next to the king) went to the boy with gifts, and said &amp;#8220;these are all for you if you heal me&amp;#8221;. The boy said &amp;#8220;Truly Allah heals. If you believe in Him, I will pray to Him, and He will heal you.</description>

      <description>If you have multiple skills and multiple interests, how can you determine the best use of your skills for da&amp;#8217;wah? Try this method inshaAllah.
 Skills: List all your skills. Ummah: Prioirtize the needs of the ummah (i.e. your community). Map and Prioritize: Tie each skill to an action, and prioritize according to need.  For example, if your skills are writing, graphic design, and drama, and your ummah needs youth involvement and education, you may decide to:</description>

We see many examples of this&amp;#8211;people join the local MSA, and spend 40 hours a week to keep it alive. And the next year, you see them in the bar, with their girlfriend or boyfriend. Or others spend months putting together The Biggest Conference Ever, and while it goes on, they miss all the lectures and mill around outside with their friends, or out in the parking lot arguing about lunches.</description>

      <description>Familiarize yourself with Ar-Rajal, companion to the fake prophet Musaylimah.
Many people believe that when you don&amp;#8217;t practice Islam 100%, you&amp;#8217;re not hurting anyone but yourself. But subhanallah, if you look at Ar-Rajal, how many people did he misguide by not practicing Islam? Howmany tens or hundreds or thousands joined Musaylimah because Ar-Rajal endorsed him?
If you work or attend school, look around you. How many &amp;#8220;Muslims&amp;#8221; do you know who don&amp;#8217;t wear a beard, don&amp;#8217;t observe hijab, they drink, they go clubbing, they have a girlfriend or boyfriend.</description>

Clarifies: With commands like &amp;#8220;amputate the hand of the theif&amp;#8221;, it clarifies (they must steal something worth 25 dinar or more, the item must be properly guarded, it cannot be food, etc.</description>

What excellent companions these are that one may get! [Surah An-Nisaa, verse 69]

Why stones, you ask? Because idols are made of stones. Subhanallah. People and stones will fuel the Hellfire, the way gasoline fuels cars. May Allah protect us all from that horrid end, ameen.

      <description>Musaylimah used to pray three times a day. He used to lie and say Qur&amp;#8217;an was revealed to him, and he&amp;#8217;d make up verses of &amp;#8220;Qur&amp;#8217;an&amp;#8221;. In one instance, the people came to him and asked &amp;#8220;was anything revealed?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Not yet.&amp;#8221; And later, &amp;#8220;anything yet?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Nope.&amp;#8221;. And later &amp;#8220;Anything yet?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Nope.&amp;#8221;
At one point, some people came to him and one said &amp;#8220;was anything revealed to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)?</description>

      <description>A man came to the Prophet (salallhu alayhi wa sallam) from Al-Yamamah, learned some Quran, and apostated and joined Musalimah. His kunya (pet-name) was Ar-Rajal (&amp;#8220;the man&amp;#8221;). He endorsed Musaylimah.
His fitna was more intense then Musaylimah. People thought he was learned and scholarly, and he believed in Musaylimah. It caused a huge doubt among the ignorant people. They felt that if Ar-Rajal listened, they should listen, too.
Today, everyone has endorsements.</description>

      <description>To know your identity, know your roots.
One way to destroy a people is to isolate them from their roots.
Muslims today remain ignorant of their identity. Who was the Prophet, (صلي الله عليه وسلم)? What was he like? Who are Abu Bakr, &amp;#8216;Umar, &amp;#8216;Aisha, Az-Zubayr, Abu Darda? Who was Imam Shafi&amp;#8217;ee, Imam Malik, Salahuddin (may Allah be pleased with all of them)?
So study your history! Read the seerah of the Prophet, the seerah of the Khulafa, and Islamic history &amp;#8212; including major figures like the four imams, Salahuddin, and others.</description>

So you be the prophet of the Hijaz area (very hilly area near the sea where the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) resided) and I&amp;#8217;ll be the prophet of the Najd area.&amp;#8221;

Malik ibn An-Nuwayrah, during the time of Abu Bakr as-Siddique, radiallahu &amp;#8216;an, did not want to pay zakaah. There&amp;#8217;s a difference of opinion, and Allahu &amp;#8216;alim, he (Malik ibn An-Nuwayrah) was not Muslim.

      <description>Storytelling is a fundamental da&amp;#8217;wah technique. It effortlessly communicates a message in a memorable medium. Storytelling is so powerful that you see it in the Qur&amp;#8217;an (Surah Baqarah and Surah Yusuf, for example), in ahadith (The People of the Ditch).
Among the benefits: storytelling communicates a message without spelling it out. Human beings recall stories more easily then they recall other forms of teaching. With a story, you can continually extract lessons and benefit from it.</description>

Looking for an inexpensive asset to deposit continual good deeds into your akhira bank account?

      <description>The key to gender interaction (aka gender relations) is professionalism.

She said (to the effect of) &amp;#8220;nope&amp;#8221;. She approached the Prophet and narrated the incident to him, and he said &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;Umar was incorrect.

      <description>Common reactions among many types of people when their spouse burns their food, or forgets the salt, or oversalts, or otherwise destroys it, are statements such as &amp;#8220;what&amp;#8217;s wrong with you, don&amp;#8217;t you know how to cook&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;didn&amp;#8217;t your mother/father ever teach you anything&amp;#8221; and so on.
Remain patient, as the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) remained when his wives cooked food he didn&amp;#8217;t like. He sat, and said nothing at all, nor did he eat from it.</description>

      <description>From the teachings of the khulafa rashideen: when you&amp;#8217;re about to do something, ask yourself: &amp;#8220;Would I be happy and unregretful of how I spent my time today?&amp;#8221;
If the answer is &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221;, then find something better to do with your time.
And remember: Time is one of the ONLY irreversable resources. Money comes and goes, status builds, but time, once it&amp;#8217;s gone, it never comes back.
The Prophet, peace and blessings upon him, said: Two things about which people are deceived are their health and their time.</description>

      <description>The true measure of leadership is influence, nothing more, and nothing less. When you can influence people, you&amp;#8217;re a leader, even if nobody recognizes you. And when you can&amp;#8217;t influence people, you&amp;#8217;re not a leader &amp;#8212; even if the masjid says so, or the organization says so, or your friends say so, or your car says so.
And remember the command of the Prophet, peace be upon him: Do not covet leadership, for it entails blame, regret, and punishment on the Day of Judgement &amp;#8212; except for the just ruler.</description>

وَإِذَا لَقُواْ الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُواْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَى شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا مَعَكْمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِؤُونَ  Translation: &amp;#8220;When they meet those who believe, they say &amp;#8216;we believe,&amp;#8217; but when they are alone with their shayateen, they say &amp;#8216;we are with you&amp;#8216; &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; (Al-Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:14)1
Although the hypocrites say they believe, they associate their identities with shayateen (devils, or &amp;#8220;evil ones&amp;#8221;).
The lesson: your belief system shapes your identity.</description>

      <description>If you want your Islamic work&amp;#8211;your project, or organization, or masjid, or whatever it is&amp;#8211;to survive you, you need to train leaders, not followers.
When you train followers, they work well, for a time&amp;#8211;a month, or two, or a year, or ten, or 20&amp;#8211;but without a leader, the project collapses. Instead, train leaders, who in turn train followers and other leaders in your absence, and the cycle perpetuates inshaAllah.
This is also part of what you need to transform your project from a mom-and-pop-style business to an independant self-existing entity.</description>

Among the many means to strengthen include constant rememberance of Allah and reminders of the hereafter. Ask Allah to strengthen your eman, and inshaAllah even your low-points become higher and higher over time.</description>

      <description>During the reign of Prophet Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم), and later, the reign of Abu Bakr, the first Khalifa, may Allah be pleased with him, Khalid bin Walid, commander of the Muslim army, rocked the non-Muslim armies again and again and again and lead the Muslims to many victories. In this way, he became a fitnah&amp;#8211;people ascribed victory to him, and not to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).
After the battle of Yarmuk, the newly-instated Khalifa, &amp;#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) removed Khalid bin Walid from leadership of the army and instated Abu Ubaydah (RA) as the commander.</description>

      <description>Some companions asked the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) &amp;#8220;Who are the people most tested?&amp;#8221; The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said &amp;#8220;The rightly guided people.&amp;#8221;
Allah tests people according to the strength of their faith. As you increase in iman, your tests become tougher and tougher. Allah tests everyone, even non-believers. So if you&amp;#8217;re going to be tested, be tested for fleeing to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and the truth.</description>

      <description>The scholar/monk said to the boy, after he defeated the beast: verily, you will be tested.
The sunnah of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is to test those who come with the truth &amp;#8211;place tests in their path. When the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) first received revelation and visited Waraqa, he said: I wish I had the life/strength to live until the time when your people kick you out.

      <description>After the boy killed the lion, news spread fast&amp;#8211;news arrives like an ant and leaves like an elephant. Sensationalism.
The boy meets the scholar and informs him of what occurred. The scholar replied with: &amp;#8220;O my boy, today you are better then me. You will be tested, so when it happens, do not reveal me (don&amp;#8217;t rat me out).&amp;#8221;

A beast blocked the path of the people. The boy said: &amp;#8220;O Allah, if the monk is dearer to you, then kill the beast.&amp;#8221; He threw the stone, hit the beast, and it died. (The people came to celebrate him as a great hero.)

      <description>In Islam, lying is haram (prohibited: to lie entails a sin, and to abstain from it enails good deeds). However, there are three circumstances in which a lie is allowed: for a husband to create love and tranqulity between himself and his wife, for one to settle disputes, and in war.
 For a man to create harmony with his wife: One may lie to one&amp;#8217;s wife in order to create peace and avoid arguementation&amp;#8211;for example, if one&amp;#8217;s wife asks &amp;#8220;do I looks fat and ugly?</description>

      <description>The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) asked Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) for His protection from shirk. So why do we act like we know we&amp;#8217;ll die Muslim? Remember, this is the Prophet of Allah. He spoke to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) without any barrier. He received revelation directly from Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). He is the best of creation.
So seek protection in Allah from shirk, the unforgivable sin that destroys good deeds. The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us the following du&amp;#8217;a:</description>

      <description>All people on Earth seek happiness&amp;#8211;whether it&amp;#8217;s through wealth, or love, or piety. Few realize that perfect happiness does not exist in the dunya. When you think about it, you&amp;#8217;ll find that hardship and pain exist with moments of great happiness. For example, you ate your favourite meal after a long time, but you feel over-full and you become tired and lazy. Or, you enjoy a wonderful hike through the woods, minus the insect bites and that bee that flew into your ear.</description>

      <description>Never label. Human beings are not two-dimensional that you can slap a label onto them and classify them. One of the best ways to destroy ties between people, groups, and organizations is to label them. Even if they deserve it, don&amp;#8217;t do it.
When you find yourself applying a label to someone, ask yourself: Will this action please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)?
When you find others who label, back away. You don&amp;#8217;t want to involve yourself with people like that.</description>

      <description>In one of the battles in the time of the Khulafa Rashideen, the Muslim armies attacked a fort behind a trench.
With a trench, defenses spread thin: 500 people need to guard all points of the trench. So in any given area, you have only a few guards.
How did the Muslims succeed? They find the one lazy guy&amp;#8211;if the trench is eight feet deep and six feet across, they find the location two feet deep and one foot across&amp;#8211;and focus the entire army towards that one location, all the hundreds or thousands of mujahideen.</description>

Don&amp;#8217;t be like the shopkeeper who keeps the door to his shop closed all the time in order to keep it clean. No customers enter. If you&amp;#8217;re always closed and looking for perfection, you&amp;#8217;ll shut down.</description>

It also means the consulted group. Shura is a fundamental technique in leadership. The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), the best and most knowledable and noble of people, practiced shura with his companions&amp;#8211;and who knew better than he?

In the battle of Yamamah, when Abdullah ibn &amp;#8216;Umar (RA) lay in the nursing docks after one battle, he heard a shout from outside&amp;#8211;ya ahlil ansar, &amp;#8220;o people of the Ansar&amp;#8221;.

They did not compete for the largest house or the biggest family. They competed, among other things, for the honour of guard ingthe Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) in battle.
They divided into tribes and competed with other tribes. The amirs, too, competed with each other. For example, in the campaign in Ash-Sham, the two armies competed&amp;#8211;who could be the fastest to fight their way to the key city?</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/the-key-to-happiness/</guid>
      <description>Happiness lies in rememberence of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and His blessings. It keeps you happy. One guy performed Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) once, and complained about the crush of the crowd. But would you be happy if you were the only Muslim there? No way. You&amp;#8217;d hate it. So remember the blessings even when Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) tests you with difficult tests.
Tip: When you say Al-Hamdullilah, mean it. Think about a specific blessing Allah blessed you with.</description>

      <description>After the death of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), many tribes apostated from Islam. Some stopped paying zakaah (poor-due), and some tribe leaders claimed prophethood. Many of the common people at that time lacked education. The emotional charge of the situation swept up many of the Muslims.
Protect yourself. If you allow the river of emotion to sweep you up, in a lot of cases, it will misguide you towards the wrong direction.</description>

      <description>One of the fundamental war techniques of Khalid bin Walid (radiallahu &amp;#8216;anh) is that he never wasted time. He might make mistakes from it, but he moved the entire army at the speed of a single rider. Most armies crawl at a slow pace, but his army moved quickly. The Muslims were all very well disciplined. If you were in his army, you moved fast.
He moved so quickly that after one battle took place at one village, before the defenders regrouped, he arrived at the next village and attacked.</description>

      <description>If you possess some skill you can utilize to the benefit of the people everywhere, never hold back. Don&amp;#8217;t hold it to yourself. Forget about what other people are thinking. Focus on how they can benefit from it. This applies especially if a) you have relatively rare talents, or b) nobody knows about your skills.
Wallahu &amp;#8216;alim.</description>

      <description>As Islamic workers, we never lower our standers. Not as volunteers, not as professionals, and not as Muslims. Always strive to the best of your abilities. And inshaAllah this way, your skills and talent grow faster than if you barely use them.
Never fall into the trap of so many people who produce second-rate material &amp;#8220;just because&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s for Islamic work, and not for their own (percieved/worldly) benefit.
And remember: ihsaan means excellence, not perfection.</description>

      <description>Good teachers need good students, and good students need good teachers. When either teachers or students are not up to par, knowledge wastes. Either the teacher fails to teach at their best capability, or the students learn nothing. The same concept can apply to leadership&amp;#8211;good leaders require good followers, and good followers require good leaders.
Wallahu &amp;#8216;alim. Are YOU a good teacher and a good student?
Something to think about inshaAllah.</description>

      <description>A Saudi guy walks into a bar, decked out in his thobe and kufi. (He doesn&amp;#8217;t believe in the meat of the People of the Book arguement.) He walks up to the bar and says &amp;#8220;Bartender, I want a chicken sandwich.&amp;#8221;
The bartender looks at him, nods, and turns to fill the order.
A desi guy who sits nearby stares. The Saudi guy turns to the desi guy. Black spiked hair, leather jacket, one hand clamps around the handle of a half-filled mug of beer.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/influence-leaders-dont-import/</guid>
      <description>Influence leaders, don&amp;#8217;t import your own. When you need to influence masses of people towards your ideology (da&amp;#8217;wah) or project or cause, don&amp;#8217;t bring your speaker in to preach to them. It doesn&amp;#8217;t consistantly work&amp;#8211;if the people don&amp;#8217;t know your leader, they can&amp;#8217;t trust him, and most will refuse to follow him.
Instead, influence the leader of the people you wish to lead. Once he agrees to your cause, he automatically spreads it to those who follow him.</description>

      <description>Good workers are rare. Great workers are more rare. Outstanding workers are still more rare. Instead of investing hundreds of hours in the search for excellent workers, take what you can get&amp;#8211;given that they hold some of the attributes you need, and the potential to grow&amp;#8211;and increase them in their excellence.
This way, not only do you benefit from the work they produce, but they benefit from the training. Think of it as an investment that pays off long-term.</description>

      <title>When you Choose a Leader, Someone ALWAYS Disagrees</title>

      <description>When you choose a leader, someone always disagrees with you. No matter who you are and who your leader is, you cannot please everyone. So get used to it inshaAllah.
During the time of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) chose &amp;#8216;Usama ibn Zayd (son of Zayid ibn Thabit, may Allah be pleased with them both) as the leader of the army. And they had high-status alumni sahaba in that army, like &amp;#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab (radiallahu &amp;#8216;anh), who was in his 40s or so.</description>

      <title>Leadership at the Front and Leadership from the Back</title>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2006/leadership-at-the-front-and-leadership-from-the-back/</guid>
      <description>Front Leaders: These leaders take charge, set the vision, and lead the way. They take the initiative, and step up to the call when Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) calls them.
Back Leaders: These leaders encourage, gather everyone&amp;#8217;s opinion, call meetings, and encourage mutual agreement and compromise.
In Islaimc work, and in any project, you need both types of leadership. Like when a group hikes through a trail. You need someone at the front to pick the path and set the pace.</description>

      <title>The People of the Ditch (3): Oppression, Magic, and the Monk</title>

      <description>During the time of these people, they had a king who claimed he was Allah&amp;#8211;similar to how Fir&amp;#8217;aun, in the Qur&amp;#8217;an, claims to be Allah.
There is no oppresser that maintains his power without magic. Even today? you might ask.
Even today.
In the Qur&amp;#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:
قَالَ أَلْقُوْاْ فَلَمَّا أَلْقَوْاْ سَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَاءوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ  Translation: Moses said &amp;#8220;Throw ye (first).&amp;#8221; So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic (Surah Al-Araf, 7:116).</description>

      <description>When the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) first claimed prophethood, Abu Dhar sent his brother to Mecca to investigate and see information he could turn up. His brother investigated and returned. He said (to the meaning of): &amp;#8220;A person claims prophethood. The people call him a liar.&amp;#8221; Abu Dhar said (to the meaning of): &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s not enough information, I will go myself and find out more.&amp;#8221; (Bear in mind this is a time and place where whole tribes convert or fight Islam whole-scale based on their leaders.</description>

      <description>Expect several posts on tafseer and lessons from the story of the People of the Ditch, the background to Surah Burooj.
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&amp;#8217;an:
وَالْيَوْمِ الْمَوْعُودِ
وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ
قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ
النَّارِ ذَاتِ الْوَقُودِ
إِذْ هُمْ عَلَيْهَا قُعُودٌ
وَهُمْ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ شُهُودٌ
وَمَا نَقَمُوا مِنْهُمْ إِلَّا أَن يُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ  Translation: By the promised Day (of Judgment), by one that witnesses, and the subject of the witness: woe to the makers of the pit (of fire), fire supplied (abundantly) with fuel.</description>

      <title>Effective Management: Abstraction</title>

      <description>Abstraction: Selective ignorance of certain elements in order to focus on other elements.
In software development, abstraction means you zoom out and see the big picture. You ignore minor implementation details&amp;#8211;what are the little pieces? How do they work?&amp;#8211;and focus on the whole. These are the systems and how they fit together, and this is the overall goal.
When you employ abstraction, efficiency increases. No longer bogged down with function pointers, memory management, or 16-bit register values, you focus on how to make your software work better.</description>

      <description>To optimize your meetings and keep them clear, concise, and on-topic, follow the following two rules as much as possible:
Two Cents: Keep your two cents out of it. Nobody wants to hear your opinion anyway, and spewing one opinion denies other opinions their right. When you compound personal opinion with rebuttal with re-rebuttal, your main topic quickly derails. (Never tolerate deviations from this rule.)
Two Sentences: _When you speak, l_imit your dialogue to two sentences max.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t judge a book by its cover or a man by his beard, because what&amp;#8217;s behind the beard can be weird.&amp;#8221; Apply this to your lives, and you&amp;#8217;ll find that, bi ithnillah (by the permission of Allah), you will never be surprised or dissapointed. When you make great assumptions about people, where can they go except down?
Great assumptions often lead to great letdowns. Wallahu &amp;#8216;alim.</description>

The dunya can throw a bigger army at you, better weapons, everything and anything. And if you fear Allah the way He deserves to be feared, none of that can overshadow your fear of the Creator.</description>

      <description>MultiTimer, a lightweight application, allows you to track your time commitments to multiple items simultaneously. You type in the timer label, set the inital time and count method (countup or countdown), and the application handles the rest.
In particular, if you need to track (and, optionally, aggregate) time usage for multiple projects, you can assign one timer per project and track your time use per day. Or per week. Or per month.</description>

      <description>This article by Steve Pavlina explains how to effectively manage your life by focusing on tasks based on their long-term effects.
The article defines three categories of tasks, and allocates your daily time to each of them proportionally based on their expected benefit.
 &amp;#8220;A&amp;#8221; tasks yield benefit in five or more years, such as learning a new language. &amp;#8220;B&amp;#8221; tasks yield benefit in two or more years, such as training for a marathon.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Islamic work isn&amp;#8217;t something we do for a hobby&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s our life.&amp;#8221; Work for the cause, don&amp;#8217;t abandon it. Don&amp;#8217;t neglect it to play video games or watch TV or surf the internet. It isn&amp;#8217;t a hobby. It isn&amp;#8217;t part-time. It&amp;#8217;s full-time, all out, no holds-barred work for the cause of Allah.
If you consider the illustrious sahaba, radiallahu &amp;#8216;anhuma ajma&amp;#8217;een, they all gave their all for the cause. Their wealth, their health, their free time, even their very lives.</description>

      <guid>http://ilmfruits.com/2005/few-things-are-worth-crying-over/</guid>
      <description>&amp;#8220;Very few things in life are worth crying over.&amp;#8221; Ponder it. Very few things in life are worth throwing a fit over or complaining about. In Islamic work, especially, people attach importantance to things that aren&amp;#8217;t issues, tempers rise, fights break out, and brotherhood dies. And in the end, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) controls over all things.
So sit back, chill out, and let it run by you. No harm done, right?</description>
