      <description>Below is some naseeha from our brother, Sa&amp;#8217;ad Gaya. Sa&amp;#8217;ad was one of those 18 individuals thrown in jail as part of the &amp;#8220;Toronto 18 terrorist plot.&amp;#8221; Despite evidence that the entire plot was spurred by a CSIS mole, despite an increasing lack of any credible evidence, several of these 18 brothers are still languishing in a jail cell.
  My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I write these words not as one who has any superiority over you , whether in knowledge or deeds.</description>
