      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is post #22 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/forest-night-light.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; title=&#34;a blinding light emitting from a forest at night&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1233&#34; /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;The protection of Allah is easily earned and very, very powerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims love talking about Jinns and black magic. Yet, when it comes to inoculating themselves from supernatural forces, Muslims are often either ignorantly doing &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of what they need to do, or proverbially standing on the interstate highway, woefully oblivious of thousands of cars speeding by at near-miss distances. And many of us, or people we know, personally &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even the newest Muslim is often quickly equipped with powerful shields of protection against these forces. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&amp;#8216;Abdullah bin &amp;#8216;Amr bin al-&amp;#8216;Aas (رضي الله عنه‏) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:
 There are two characteristics that no servant possesses except that he will enter Paradise. They are both very easy, but those who act upon them are quite few:
The first is that one of you says &amp;#8216;Subhan Allah&amp;#8217; ten times, &amp;#8216;al-Hamdu lillah&amp;#8217; ten times, and &amp;#8216;Allahu Akbar&amp;#8217; ten times after each prayer.</description>
