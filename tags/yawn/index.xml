      <description>بِسْمِ اللَّـهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
 This is the continuation of the series, that focuses on implementing sunnah in our lives. In the last post, we talked about the manners of sleeping. In this post, we will look at the Sunnahs of sneezing and yawning:
 Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &amp;ldquo;Allah loves sneezing but dislikes yawning; so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises Allah, every Muslim who hears him (praising Allah) has to say Tashmit to him.</description>
