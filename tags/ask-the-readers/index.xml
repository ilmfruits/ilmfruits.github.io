      <description>Alhamdulillah, all praise and thanks is due to Allah, who has made Ilm Fruits alhamdulillah a very successful blog. Our recent post on salah questions (and their answers) got a lot of questions (masha&amp;#8217;Allah alhamdulillah), so we&amp;#8217;re going to take it a step further and roll out &amp;#8230; a series.
Insha&amp;#8217;Allah, starting April 6th (Monday), for the month of April, we&amp;#8217;re going to have a series on a single topic. What does this mean?</description>

      <description>Edit: Jazakumullahu khayran to everybody who provided feedback. It seems like there&amp;#8217;s a lot of demand for this kind of thing. Insha&amp;#8217;Allah we&amp;#8217;ll see more posts like this in the future.
Bismillah.
Salah. We cannot emphasize the importance of salah&amp;#8211;the dividing line of Islam and Kufr. The first thing asked about on the Day of Judgment. The last thing the Messenger of Allah mentioned before he passed away.
Maybe you&amp;#8217;ve been Muslim a day.</description>
