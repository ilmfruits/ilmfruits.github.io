We live in an era where knowledge is abundant and is available at our finger tips in variety of formats (audio, video, ebooks&amp;#8230;) and on variety of devices and platforms (tablets, smartphones, laptops&amp;#8230;.).

      <description>The following is a guest post from I Got it Covered, a blog about hijab, Islam, and life. You can find the original article here.
In the time of &amp;#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab, radiAllahu anhu, the second Khalifah, it was mandatory upon all the young girls to learn Surat an-Noor.
From the beauty of this Surah is that it begins with, &amp;#8220;[This is] a surah which We have sent down and made [that within it] obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember&amp;#8221; [Surat an-Noor: 1].</description>

      <description>Note: This is the third post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.

Allah (swt) starts the revelation commanding the Prophet to read &amp;#8220;Recite in the name of your Lord who created.</description>
