      <description>Someone asked Al-Abbas (radiallahu anhu), the uncle of rasulullah, a question: are you akbar than rasulullah?
In Arabic, literally, this means &amp;#8220;are you greater than rasulullah.&amp;#8221; But the obvious connotation is that the questioner asks about age: are you older than him?
Al-Abbas said:
 رسول الله أكبر مني و لكن ولدت قبله
Rasulullah is greater than me, but I was born before him.
 He wanted to set the record set, and give a clear message to all of us.</description>
