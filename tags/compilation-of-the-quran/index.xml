      <description>Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ood (رضي الله عنه‏) is one of the most well-known companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). (Can someone suggest some good links that detail his biography?) Orientalists&amp;#8211;who do not generally fabricate&amp;#8211;claim that, prior to the Second Compilation, Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ood&amp;#8217;s (رضي الله عنه‏) mushaf had two extra surahs that our mushafs today don&amp;#8217;t have. If you investigate this claim, you find that, indeed, it&amp;#8217;s authentically report that his mushaf had two extra chapters.</description>

      <description>The Qur&amp;#8217;an was first compiled during the lifetime of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (رضي الله عنه‏), the first khalifa, whose rule lasted from the death of the last messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for two years.
Why wasn&amp;#8217;t it compiled during the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself?
 On-Going Revelation: Revelation was still coming down. If you wrote two verses next to each other, and Allah revealed one in the middle&amp;#8211;or an extension to the end of a surah&amp;#8211;what then?</description>
