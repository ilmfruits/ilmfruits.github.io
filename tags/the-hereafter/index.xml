      <description>This is post #38 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
Allah (&amp;#8216;azza wa jal) says in Surah Al-Ghaashiyah:
 هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ
 Translation: Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming [event]? [Surah Ghashiya, verse 1]
The surah starts with a question, to make you think. The companions would say: Allahu wa rasuluhu a&amp;#8217;lam (know better), out of humbleness, even know they had an answer in mind.</description>

      <description>Umar (RA) passed by a garbage dump and stopped there, and it was as if his companions were bothered by it (the smell). He said [&amp;#8230; full story at the end&amp;#8230;]
What would you think of someone who goes for umra on a 1 week trip. He goes there, buys a car, clothes, house, grocery, &amp;#8230;.. He even takes dollars with him and doesn&amp;#8217;t exchange them into local currency! We would think that something is wrong with that person.</description>

      <title>Al-Hakumu At-Takathur …</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is post #17 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/empty-grave.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;empty-grave&#34; title=&#34;empty-grave&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1187&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graves &amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allah says, in Surah At-Takaathur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حَتَّى زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you, until you visit the graveyards. [Surah At-Takaathur, verses 1-2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subhanallah, even though these verses were revealed over 1400 years ago, we still see the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; situation today. Al-Haakum means, it makes you compete with each other. At-Takaathur is rivalry, competition, in accumulating material things; thinking that life is about toys, and the one with the most (or most expensive) toys wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Takaathur?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
