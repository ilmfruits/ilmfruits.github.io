      <description>&amp;#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه‏) was the second khalifa, and one of the ten companions promised Jannah in their lifetimes.
&amp;#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه‏) used to be a soldier&amp;#8211;one of the best. But when he became the khalifah, the other companions refused to let him fight&amp;#8211;he disagreed with them, but in the end, he stayed back in Medinah while the battles waged. Yet he always made one du&amp;#8217;a, publicly and privately, throughout his khilafah: &amp;#8220;Allahumma ruziqniy shahaadah,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;O Allah, provide me with martyrdom.</description>
