      <description>Bismillah.
Ar-Rahman: The Entirely Merciful, Ar-Raheem: The Especially Merciful 
Both of the names Rahman and Raheem come from the root Ra-ha-meem (ر ح م), these names are similar so they require a parallel explanation. What is Rahmah? Rahmah is mercy. In the dictionary it means: compassion, kindness and gentleness. Also when a person is kind, compassionate and tenderhearted towards the other. So Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem: The One who has a lot of Rahmah, The One who shows a lot of rahmah, He expresses a lot of Rahmah.</description>

      <description>Bismillah.
Ismul Jalaalah, The Grand Name: Allah الله. This is Allah&amp;#8217;s Personal Name. His Identifying Name. This Name only belongs to Allah, no one else can have besides Allah. Allah is the Title, the Name, of the One True Ilaah. The Name of Allah, you cannot play around with: there is no plural, there is no feminine. The Name Allah appears over 3000 times in the Qur&amp;#8217;an.
When we mentioned the Name &amp;#8220;Allah&amp;#8221; linguistically, we don&amp;#8217;t say &amp;#8220;the word Allah&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;the Name Allah&amp;#8221; because it is not appropriate.</description>
