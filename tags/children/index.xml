      <description>There he stood. A grown man, towering to the sky. Broad shoulders, and so much pain in his eyes. I know it&amp;#8217;s impossible, yet I could hear his heart sobbing. In reality though it was just the sound of my own pumping away. I stopped, asked, and what I was about to hear would break my heart in pieces. It&amp;#8217;s a painful encounter I&amp;#8217;ve heard over and over again of parents who&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8216;lost&amp;#8217; their children for one reason or another to drugs, alcohol, fame, money, friends, etc.</description>

      <title>10 Examples of How Rasulullah Treated Children</title>

The sunnah contains many examples of how rasulullah (ﷺ) dealt with children.
Why is this important? Because he&amp;#8217;s our uswah, our role-model, our example to follow. Many of his companions met him once or twice, saw him doing something once or twice, and as a result, would keep doing that thing until they died. Not because he told them to, but because they loved him, and sought to follow him as much as possible.</description>

      <title>The Elephant Theory</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2015/the-elephant-theory/</link>

      <description>As we mentioned with the sandwich theory, with children, always separate the behaviour from the person. Never say things like, &amp;#8220;I hate you&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re a loser,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;idiot,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;stupid,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I wish I never had you!&amp;#8221; Some of us heard this from our own parents. Are we now our own parents? Are we passing on this disease? This DNA has to be out.
The elephant theory is quite simple: young elephants are trained, with one leg that&amp;#8217;s shackled to a cement block.</description>

      <title>The Sandwich Theory</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2015/the-sandwich-theory/</link>

      <description>The sandwich theory encapsulates the idea of how to advice others (children, spouse, etc.) with the goal of minimizing resistance. Human beings naturally resist being told that they&amp;#8217;re doing something wrong and need to change.
The sandwich theory is simple: a sandwich consists of a nice, soft bun, followed by meat, followed by another soft bun. The heart of the sandwich (or burger) is really the meat.
How do you implement this?</description>

      <title>Twelve Things About the Terrible Twos</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2014/twelve-things-about-the-terrible-twos/</link>

      <description>Definition and Asl Definition: &amp;#8220;Terrible twos&amp;#8221; occur when children are between the ages of one and three years old. This is usually when children throw a lot of tantrums, and rebel, saying &amp;#8220;no!&amp;#8221; to many things you tell them. How can you effectively deal with this situation?
First, understand the root (asl): children cannot keep their strong emotions inside. They cry, they scream, they stomp, they fling themselves on the floor.</description>

      <title>The Responsibility of Children &#43; 21 Theory</title>
      <link>http://ilmfruits.com/2014/the-responsibility-of-children-21-theory/</link>

      <description>Responsibility: Reward and Punishment It&amp;#8217;s our responsibility to take are of our children, especially their akhirah &amp;#8212; their eternal life. Allah says:
Translation: O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones [&amp;#8230;] (Surah At-Tahrim, verse 66)
This ayah illustrates our responsibility: protect yourselves, and your children, from Hellfire &amp;#8212; a fire whose fuel is stones and men. Would you raise your children, knowingly, that they are going to be firewood, or fuel for the fire?</description>
