      <description>Israel is bombing Gaza. Again. In two days, there are 400 dead and 1400 injured. Hospitals overflowing, boycotts, blood, and dead bodies&amp;#8230;

Do you feel the pain?

      <description>How would you like to give sadaqa? You might say &amp;#8220;sure, I&amp;#8217;d like to do it&amp;#8211;but I have no money!&amp;#8221; What if I told you there&amp;#8217;s a way to give sadaqa that doesn&amp;#8217;t require money? That, in fact, you could even out-class the rich people in their sadaqa! All it takes is a little time and effort!

      <description>In a report by Abdullah bin `Amr bin `Aas (radiallahu &amp;#8216;anhu), he related that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah with her daughter. On the daughter&amp;#8217;s wrist were two heavy gold bracelets. The Messenger asked her, &amp;#8220;Do you pay Zakaat on this?&amp;#8221; She replied, &amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221; The Messenger said: &amp;#8220;Would it please you that Allah will encircle you with two bracelets of fire?&amp;#8221; The reporter commented that she took them off and threw them down in front of the Messenger, and said: &amp;#8220;They are for Allah and his Messenger.</description>
