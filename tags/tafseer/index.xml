      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is post #25 in our series on Tafseer of Juz ‘Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reason-of-revelation&#34;&gt;Reason of Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) told the companions about a man of the previous nations; a man who lived and fought jihad for over 1000 months (roughly 83 years, 4 months). (In case you didn&amp;#8217;t know, the previous nations lived longer than us&amp;#8211;like Prophet Nuh (alayhi salaam), who did da&amp;#8217;wah for nearly 1000 years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companions were amazed, and they said: how can we compete with him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And subhanallah, this is a gem. &lt;em&gt;Look at the companions.&lt;/em&gt; They &lt;strong&gt;prioritized and competed for the akhirah.&lt;/strong&gt; Subhanallah to the point that, they don&amp;#8217;t just try to do &amp;#8220;some good deeds before I die;&amp;#8221; not enough. They competed with each other&amp;#8211;but even that was not enough. Rather, &lt;span class=&#34;gem&#34;&gt;they competed with all of the Muslims, ever, starting from the time of Prophet Adam, until the Day of Judgment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to really look at ourselves and see, how much are we like them? Or are we just vying for bigger houses, better cars&amp;#8211;more dunya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bismillah
Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur’an,
كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُوْلُوا الْأَلْبَابِ  &amp;#8220;(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may ponder over its verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” Surah Saad: verse 29.
(linguistic explanation of the word yaddabaroo is in the comments)
It is the science of tafseer which is the fruit of ‘pondering over its verses’.</description>
