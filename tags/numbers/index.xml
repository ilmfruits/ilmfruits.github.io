      <description>One of the things we need to understand about Arabic culutre is the significance of the number &amp;#8220;seven.&amp;#8221; This boils over into our understanding of ahadith.
First, a strong disclaimer: Islam has nothing to do with numerology &amp;#8212; that is, the study and assignment of arbitrary numbers to the value of letters of the Arabic alphabet &amp;#8212; such as the popular &amp;#8220;786&amp;#8221; which represents &amp;#8220;bismillah.&amp;#8221;
Nor should numbers be interpreted symbolically or otherwise, unless there is a very good, strong reason for doing so &amp;#8212; such as with number seven.</description>
