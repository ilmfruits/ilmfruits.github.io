      <description>How would you like to give sadaqa? You might say &amp;#8220;sure, I&amp;#8217;d like to do it&amp;#8211;but I have no money!&amp;#8221; What if I told you there&amp;#8217;s a way to give sadaqa that doesn&amp;#8217;t require money? That, in fact, you could even out-class the rich people in their sadaqa! All it takes is a little time and effort!
