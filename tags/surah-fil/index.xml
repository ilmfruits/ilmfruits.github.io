      <description>This is post #21 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).
The Sabab-un-Nuzool (reason of revelation) for Surah Fil well-known; you can read all about it, along with some lessons and gems, in this post by Sr. Mariam 3.36. Please read it, since I won&amp;#8217;t touch on those points.
I will mention, however, two points not mentioned there&amp;#8211;that the Christian tyrant king who brought his elephant, why did he decide to destroy the Ka&amp;#8217;bah?</description>
