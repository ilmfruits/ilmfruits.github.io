      <description>Zaid: As-Salamu &amp;#8216;Alykum
Abdur-Rahmaan: Wa-Alykum As-salam&amp;#8230;..how was your volunteer experience at the seminar?
Zaid: Alhumdullilah. But&amp;#8230;. I worked so hard for this event but no one came to me and said any thanks or any words of appreciation!
Abdur-Rahmaan: Perhaps if you niyyah was correct, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be thinking like that. If only you were doing it sincerely for the sake of Allah and expecting reward only from Him. I think you need to see a heart specialist and get some x-rays!</description>
