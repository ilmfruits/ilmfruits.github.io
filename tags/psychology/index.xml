      <description>As we mentioned with the sandwich theory, with children, always separate the behaviour from the person. Never say things like, &amp;#8220;I hate you&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re a loser,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;idiot,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;stupid,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I wish I never had you!&amp;#8221; Some of us heard this from our own parents. Are we now our own parents? Are we passing on this disease? This DNA has to be out.
The elephant theory is quite simple: young elephants are trained, with one leg that&amp;#8217;s shackled to a cement block.</description>

      <description>The sandwich theory encapsulates the idea of how to advice others (children, spouse, etc.) with the goal of minimizing resistance. Human beings naturally resist being told that they&amp;#8217;re doing something wrong and need to change.
The sandwich theory is simple: a sandwich consists of a nice, soft bun, followed by meat, followed by another soft bun. The heart of the sandwich (or burger) is really the meat.
How do you implement this?</description>
