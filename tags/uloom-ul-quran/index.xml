      <description>Qira&amp;#8217;aat. Recitations. Like other parts of Islam, Qira&amp;#8217;aat have been codified&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s a science, just like the science of hadith.
And, just like ahadith, qira&amp;#8217;aat have different types. What kind of types? Four types, actually:
 Saheeh: Authentic qira&amp;#8217;aat. To be saheeh, a qira&amp;#8217;ah must have an authentic chain of narration back to the Prophet (S), and it must conform with the Uthmanic mushaf. There are ten of these puppies&amp;#8211;not seven, as is the common misconception.</description>

We can learn five important things about the Qur&amp;#8217;an from this definition.
 The Arabic speech of Allah: The Qur&amp;#8217;an is the speech of Allah, in Arabic.</description>
