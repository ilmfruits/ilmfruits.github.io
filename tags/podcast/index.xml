      <description>Having been in Medina for so many years, Allah willed that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the Companions would return back to Makkah. Thousands marched forth to perform hajj with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that year and in that congregation he made a very important address. This was to be known as the Farewell Hajj, this was his farewell to his companions, a farewell message to the believing ummah, and in this farewell he said: &amp;#8220;I am leaving behind two memorable things, the Book of Allah and my sunnah, whoever abides by these will never go astray.</description>
