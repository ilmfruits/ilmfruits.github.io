      <description>You often hear the khatheeb or imam, right before the salah starts, saying &amp;#8220;pray as if this is your last prayer.&amp;#8221; Sure, but what does it mean, and how do we do it?
As one of the righteous people of the past said:
 Pray as if Jannah is on your right side, Hellfire is on your left side, the siraat (bridge over Hellfire) is under you, the angel of death is behind you (waiting to take your soul any minute), your sins are above you (waiting to crush and destroy you), and this is the last deed, the one that decides if you go to Jannah or Jahannam forever.</description>

      <title>Tafseer Surah Abasa: What Really Matters?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ilmfruits.com/wp-content/uploads/imperial-crown.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;imperial crown&#34; title=&#34;imperial crown&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1280&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imageCaption&#34;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s not dunya status that matters. Allah teaches us this again in Surah Abasa&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s the one with taqwa.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is post #24 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you feel if someone you love corrected you, in public, in front of everyone else? Would you feel condemned, or criticized? Would you take it more seriously than someone you don&amp;#8217;t like criticizing you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if &lt;strong&gt;Allah, the Lord of the Universe,&lt;/strong&gt; criticized you &amp;#8230; in public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
