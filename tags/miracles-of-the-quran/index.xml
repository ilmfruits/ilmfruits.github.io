      <description>Note: This is the third post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &amp;#8216;Amma.
From the opening ceremonies, to the first move of world leaders, people like to send a message. The intense revelation of the Qur’an is no different. The timing, style and content, sends a message to the final Prophet (saw) and to all of humanity.
Allah (swt) starts the revelation commanding the Prophet to read &amp;#8220;Recite in the name of your Lord who created.</description>

      <description>Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ood (رضي الله عنه‏) is one of the most well-known companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). (Can someone suggest some good links that detail his biography?) Orientalists&amp;#8211;who do not generally fabricate&amp;#8211;claim that, prior to the Second Compilation, Ibn Mas&amp;#8217;ood&amp;#8217;s (رضي الله عنه‏) mushaf had two extra surahs that our mushafs today don&amp;#8217;t have. If you investigate this claim, you find that, indeed, it&amp;#8217;s authentically report that his mushaf had two extra chapters.</description>
