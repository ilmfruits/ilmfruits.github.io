      <description>In a report by Abdullah bin `Amr bin `Aas (radiallahu &amp;#8216;anhu), he related that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah with her daughter. On the daughter&amp;#8217;s wrist were two heavy gold bracelets. The Messenger asked her, &amp;#8220;Do you pay Zakaat on this?&amp;#8221; She replied, &amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221; The Messenger said: &amp;#8220;Would it please you that Allah will encircle you with two bracelets of fire?&amp;#8221; The reporter commented that she took them off and threw them down in front of the Messenger, and said: &amp;#8220;They are for Allah and his Messenger.</description>
