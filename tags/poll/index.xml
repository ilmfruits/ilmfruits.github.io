      <description>Alhamdulillah, all praise and thanks is due to Allah, who has made Ilm Fruits alhamdulillah a very successful blog. Our recent post on salah questions (and their answers) got a lot of questions (masha&amp;#8217;Allah alhamdulillah), so we&amp;#8217;re going to take it a step further and roll out &amp;#8230; a series.
Insha&amp;#8217;Allah, starting April 6th (Monday), for the month of April, we&amp;#8217;re going to have a series on a single topic. What does this mean?</description>
