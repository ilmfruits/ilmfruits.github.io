<p class="gem">
  Scholars say: there are no major sins with <dfn title="repentance">tawbah</dfn>, and there are no minor sins with repetiton.
</p>

What does that mean? The one who commits **major sins** and performs **tawbah** is **forgiven**; and the one who commits **minor sins** repeatedly is **overcome** by them, and they reach **the level of major sins.**

Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (رضي الله عنه) said: A believer treats a sin as if it is a mountain over his head that may fall on him any moment; whereas a dissolute person looks at it as a fly that hovers around his nose and he waves it away with his hand.<sup>1</sup>

So work hard to overcome your sins, and never despair. And remember, if you&#8217;re **not all that worried** about your sins, you could be **neck-deep** and **drowning without knowing** it.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) protect us from all kinds of sins, ameen.
