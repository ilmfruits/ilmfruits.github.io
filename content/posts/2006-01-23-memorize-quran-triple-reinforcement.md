To memorize the Qur&#8217;an, regardless of your learning style, utilize your senses (sight and sound) plus your intellect to reinforce your memorization inshaAllah.

  1. **See it:** See the Qur&#8217;an in Arabic. A tajweed colour-coded mushaf works. Pick a script you like, and read it over a few times. Learn how the letters look. Read it after you listen to it a few times.
  2. **Hear it:** Download your favourite reciter and listen to the particular verse you want to memorize. Listen at least a few times, both before and after you try to memorize.
  3. **Understand it:** Learn the translation in your native language, both of the individual words and of the ayat. When need to remember and get stuck on a word, you can always recall the translation in your native language and translate.
  4. **Associate it:** Associate words, meanings, and sounds with anything. For example, the word <span class="foreignWord">tansawna</span> (to forget) sounds like the English words &#8220;ton sauna&#8221;. _These associations greatly aid your memorization._
  5. **Practice it:** Every chance you get to recite it, in any prayer, recite it!  Recite it over and over and over and over until you can do it without hardly thinking about it.  Eventually, you reach a point where it becomes ingrained into your subconscious mind.

And of course, straighten your intention before-hand (to memorize for the reward, for example), make du&#8217;a constantly, and utilize the early part of the morning (Fajr to sunrise). May Allah aid you in your endeavour.
