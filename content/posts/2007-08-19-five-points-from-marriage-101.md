Safi Khan, in his &#8220;Marriage 101&#8243; lecture CD (available from [here][1]), mentions many points; of the best, he mentions the following:

  1. **For Brothers:** use extreme compassion and mercy towards your wives! Almost all relationships could benefit from more mercy and compassion.
  2. **For Sisters:** struggle not to complain! Once complaints start, they only get worse, and in the end, they can spoil your marriage.
  3. **For Both:**
  1. **have a common goal**&#8211;to serve Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), to worship Him, and to enter Jannah together, without reckoning.
  2. **close the doors of fitnah** – shut them off from your marriage. Keep each other&#8217;s secrets, don&#8217;t share them. Throw out your TV. Travel together on long trips.
  3. **worship Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) together** – choose some activity that you use, that you do together. Go to Islamic lectures. Read tafseer together. Start an Islamic project. Memorize Qur&#8217;an together.
