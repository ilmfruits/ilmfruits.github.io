**Among the culture of the mujahideen** is that they **honoured each others&#8217; families**. If someone died in battle, their wives were married to people of equal stature after the &#8216;iddah (mourning period).

Malik ibn An-Nuwayrah, during the time of Abu Bakr as-Siddique, radiallahu &#8216;an, did not want to pay zakaah. There&#8217;s a difference of opinion, and Allahu &#8216;alim, he (Malik ibn An-Nuwayrah) was not Muslim.

Kahlid bin Walid killed him one night. About this, Abu Bakr said: &#8220;He [Khalid, radiallahu &#8216;anh] made ijtihad and made a mistake.&#8221; They kept him in leadership of the army.

After her &#8216;iddah, Khalid (radiallahu &#8216;anh) married the wife of Malik bin An-Nuwayrah.

Subhanallah.

Orientalists use this point to attack Khalid (radiallahu &#8216;an). They turn it into a soap-opera&#8211;they attack intentions&#8211;so get the story straight.
