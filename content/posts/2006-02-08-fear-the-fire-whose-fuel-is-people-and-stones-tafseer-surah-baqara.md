In Surah Baqarah, verse 24, Allah says:

**Translation:** [&#8230;] Fear the fire **whose fuel** is **people and stones** (Surah Baqara: 2:24)

Why stones, you ask? Because _idols_ are made of stones. Subhanallah. People and stones will _fuel_ the Hellfire, the way gasoline fuels cars. May Allah protect us all from that horrid end, ameen.
