Eid Mubarak! As the sahaba would tell each other: May Allah accept our good deeds and your good deeds (from Ramadan). Ameen!

Ramadan is still fresh in your mind; the long days of fasting, the pain in your legs and back from taraweeh, and most of all, that biting regret that you didn&#8217;t do enough.

Would you like to make the next Ramadan even better? With only five minutes worth of effort?! Try this out: create a new document (by hand or computer, whatever you like) called &#8220;Ramadan Retrospective.&#8221; List out the following:

  * **What you did well.** Maybe you read more Qur&#8217;an than ever before! Or you prayed taraweeh every day. Whatever it is.
  * **What you didn&#8217;t do well enough.** Maybe you neglected your sunnah prayers because you were tired, or slept after Fajr. Write all that down.
  * **What to do better next time.** List the missed opportunities. Maybe you didn&#8217;t have a concrete plan for the last ten nights. Or you never bothered planning for &#8216;ittakaaf, and so, missed it.

The key step is to **keep this in a safe place and look at it next Ramadan.** This will insha&#8217;Allah give you a strong starting-point to move forward from. The key is to **spend some time really thinking about it.** If you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;ll just be superficial.

May Allah accept our good deeds and keep us doing them even after Ramadan has ended&#8211;ameen. And that, scholars say, is one of the best signs that your deeds were accepted.

Wallahu a&#8217;lam.

One final point&#8211;please list in the comments any lessons you learned (or heard about but maybe already knew) from Ramadan. Let&#8217;s see how much benefit we can come up with, insha&#8217;Allah. Here are a few to get you started from what I learned:

  * Eat little in Iftar, because bloat makes you sleepy in taraweeh.
  * Learn Arabic, because then taraweeh will be enjoyable, not endless.
  * Make a du&#8217;a list and use it every night in the last ten nights.
  * Pray two rakaahs before Fajr. It counts as Tahajjud!
  * Make du&#8217;a when you break your fast &#8212; that&#8217;s one of the best times.
  * Eat healthy.
