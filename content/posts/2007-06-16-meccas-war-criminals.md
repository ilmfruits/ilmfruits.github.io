In the eight year after Hijrah (8AH), the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) and his companions conquered Mecca&#8211;without a single sword-swing. 10,000 Muslim warriors arrived at the gates, and the inhabitants of Mecca raised their arms in surrender.

The norm during those days was that **when a land is conquered, ALL its people are killed**, and its women and children are taken as slaves and property. So when the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) conquered Mecca, the Meccans became frightened. And they should&#8217;ve been&#8211;this is the man who **they slandered, tortured, ridiculed, persecuted, and fought for 21 years**.

So what did he (صلي الله عليه وسلم) do when he entered?

He forgave them all.

<div class="quran">
  وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا <strong>رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ</strong>
</div>

**Translation:** And We have not sent you (O Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم)) except as **a mercy for the universe**. [Suratal Anbiyyah, 21:107]

However, there were certain individuals who were not forgiven&#8211;war criminals whose opposition reached such a level of intensity and evil, that they could not be forgiven. The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) gave this list out&#8211;these men and women were to be **executed, immediately**, and there would be no mercy for them&#8211;not in this life, and not in the next.

Who were these individuals, Mecca&#8217;s war criminals?

  1. **Wahshi**, a slave who earned his freedom in Uhud by **killing the Prophet&#8217;s uncle Hamza** (رضالله عنه) in Uhud. 
      * **Hind**, the wife of Abu Sufyaan, who ripped out the liver of Hamza&#8217;s (رضالله عنه) body, and ate it. Raw. (The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: there was never a day more painful to me then the day I stood over the body of my uncle Hamza.)
      * **Abu Sufyaan**, who&#8211;although decided to become Muslim&#8211;had to **run for his life** to the Prophet, because &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab (رضالله عنه) saw him, and chased after him! (Had &#8216;Umar (رضالله عنه) reached him before Abu Sufyaan (رضالله عنه) reached the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), &#8216;Umar (رضالله عنه) would&#8217;ve killed him! Though, once he said he wanted to become Muslim, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) forgave him.)
      * **Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl**, the son of Abu Jahl; all the Arabs considered the ka&#8217;ba sacred, it was their sanctuary&#8211;yet, even as he was **clinging to the curtains of the ka&#8217;ba**, they were pulling him away to kill him.
      * **Abdullah ibn Sa&#8217;ad**</ol> 
    Yet, subhanallah, we see the truth of this ayah&#8211;because <span class="gem">ALL of these four criminals were forgiven, and all of them accepted Islam</span>. Ikrimah (رضالله عنه) pledged to spend **double** for Islam what he spent against it; Abdullah ibn Sa&#8217;ad (رضالله عنه) became the **commander** of the Muslim navy; Wahshi **killed [Musaylimah Al-Kathaab][1]**, one of the biggest opponents of Islam during the reign of of Abu Bakr (رضالله عنه).
    
    That&#8217;s Islam for you.
