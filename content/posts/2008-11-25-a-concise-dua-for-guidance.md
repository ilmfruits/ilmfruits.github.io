Bismillah.

One of the things I decided to blog about is my own personal du&#8217;a&#8211;it&#8217;s not lifted straight from the pages of the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah, but it draws from them. My goal was to have a du&#8217;a that:

  * **Is short,** so I can recite it in sujood every rakah or every salah
  * **Is encompassing**&#8211;covers every aspect (in this case, of the akhirah)
  * **Is easy to remember**, so I can remember it as needed!
  * **Is easy,** not full of hard-to-pronounce or hard-to-remember words.

The du&#8217;a is:

> <div class="arabic" style="font-size: 32px;">
>   اللهمَّ إجعَلنِي مِن المَقَرِّبِينَ وَ مِن المُخلِصِينَ وَ مِن الصِدِّقِينَ وَ مِن المُحسِنِين
> </div>
> 
> Allahumma ij&#8217;alnee min al-muqarribeen, wa min al-mukhliseen, wa min al-muhsineen, wa min as-siddiqeen.

What does this du&#8217;a mean? It means, &#8220;O Allah, make me from among the muaqarribeen, and the mukhliseen, and the muhsineen, and the siddiqeen.&#8221; Let&#8217;s break down these four groups to see who they are:

  1. **Al-Muqarribeen:** Linguistically, it means something like &#8220;those who are close.&#8221; Islamically, it means those _closest to Allah in the hereafter_. There is no reward greater than seeing Allah&#8217;s Face, and no people will see it more than the muqarribeen. (Search the Qur&#8217;an, there are lots of references to them.)
  2. **Al-Mukhliseen:** These are the sincere ones&#8211;because your years
  
    of salah, or sawm, of Qur&#8217;an, mean _nothing_ if you are insincere. Also, Shaytan promises that he will misguide every last human&#8211;except the mukhliseen.
  3. **Al-Muhsineen:** These are the ones who do ihsaan, excellence, in every aspect. They are praised in many places of the Qur&#8217;an. It&#8217;s a great quality to have.
  4. **As-Siddiqeen:** Of the four levels mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an (prophets, siddiqeen, and two others), this is the highest level that we, today, can theoretically reach.

Obviously, you&#8217;re free to use (or not use) this du&#8217;a, or mix it up and make your own; I find it useful because it&#8217;s concise, it covers a lot of traits, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to remember.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alim.
