[Musaylimah][1] used to pray three times a day. He used to lie and say Qur&#8217;an was revealed to him, and he&#8217;d make up verses of &#8220;Qur&#8217;an&#8221;. In one instance, the people came to him and asked &#8220;was anything revealed?&#8221; &#8220;Not yet.&#8221; And later, &#8220;anything yet?&#8221; &#8220;Nope.&#8221;. And later &#8220;Anything yet?&#8221; &#8220;Nope.&#8221;

At one point, some people came to him and one said &#8220;was anything revealed to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)?&#8221; and another replied &#8220;Yeah, wal-Asr &#8230;&#8221; (Surah Asr). So they asked Musaylimah, &#8220;Was anything revealed to you, Musaylimah?&#8221; and he said something like, &#8220;&#8216;The elephant &#8230; and what will make you understand the elephant? It has a ropey tail and a long trunk.&#8217;<sup>1</sup> &#8230; What do you think?&#8221; and the person said &#8220;I swear by Allah, that _you know_ that _I know_ that you&#8217;re a liar.&#8221; And on the heels of that: &#8220;A liar from Rabiyyah (an area in Najd) is more beloved to us then a truthful person from Muddah (where the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was from).&#8221;

Subhanallah. _That&#8217;s_ tribalism.

And indeed, that is one of the miracles of Qur&#8217;an. The best speakers of Arabic language, the masters of the language, back then, failed to create even _one verse_ like it, let alone one chapter. The challange continues undefeated, as it will stay, for all time.

After all, Allah promised it to us, in Surah Baqarah?

**Translation:** And if you have doubt about what We revealed to Our slave, **create a surah like it** &#8230; and if you can&#8217;t, and you **will never be able to**, fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones &#8230;&#8221; (Surah Baqarah, 2:23-24).
