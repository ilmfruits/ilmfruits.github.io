The lie of the scholar/monk to the boy falls under the three types of [acceptable lies][1], a situation of war.

A beast blocked the path of the people. The boy said: &#8220;O Allah, if the monk is dearer to you, then kill the beast.&#8221; He threw the stone, hit the beast, and it died. (The people came to celebrate him as a great hero.)

Notice the natural inclination of the boy&#8211;to help the people. He&#8217;s attached to the people, he knew the truth, and wanted to help the people. Note also his bias towards the monk&#8211;when he made du&#8217;a, he asked about the monk. He _didn&#8217;t_ say &#8220;O Allah, if the magician is more hated to you&#8221; or &#8220;O Allah, if the magician is more beloved to you&#8221;. _He ties his love of Allah to his love of the monk_. Subhanallah.

  <strong>Fundamental Da&#8217;wah Technique: </strong>Make yourself likable to the recipient. In people&#8217;s minds, it&#8217;s almost impossible to seperate the caller from the message.<br /> May Allah allow us to learn from these shining examples of iman.
