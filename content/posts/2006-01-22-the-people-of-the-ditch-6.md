The scholar/monk said to the boy, after he defeated the beast: verily, you will be tested.

<p class="gem">
  The sunnah of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is to test those who come with the truth &#8211;place tests in their path.
</p>

When the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) first received revelation and visited Waraqa, he said: I wish I had the life/strength to live until the time when your people kick you out.

The Prophet said: Are they going to kick me out?&#8221; As in, &#8220;how do you know?&#8221;

Waraqa said: There is no man who comes with something similar, except that the people hurt him.

Similarly, when Prophet Luqman (AS) gave advice to his son, he said: Establish salaah &#8230; and have patience over what will afflict you.

So when you propogate the truth, be forewarned: they&#8217;re coming for you.

Allah tests even non-Muslims. Compared to our tests, they suffer through relatively easy tests&#8211;and flunk because of their lack of iman in Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).

May Allah make us all bearers of the truth and followers of the Prophet Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم).
