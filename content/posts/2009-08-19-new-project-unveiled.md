Bismillah.

Alhamdulillah, we&#8217;ve been working in the background for a while to launch a new project. Jazakumullahu khayran to everybody who helped out, may Allah keep giving you reward for it insha&#8217;Allah long after your bones are dust&#8211;allahumma ameen!

First, check yourself, and fill out the poll below:

[poll id=&#8221;3&#8243;]

If you haven&#8217;t guessed, our new project is: [Salah Support][1], a forum where you can find resources on salah&#8211;everything from videos on how to pray, to ebooks on khushoo&#8217;, to creative alarms for Qiaaym-ul-Layl.

We hope, bi idhnillah, that people will benefit&#8211;posting questions, and answers (with proofs, of course).

If you&#8217;re masha&#8217;Allah a regular musalli with your 5x fard salawaat secured, I request that you monitor the forums and help others get up to speed, insha&#8217;Allah. After all, the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said:

> Jarir ibn Abdullah and Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu &#8216;anhumaa) reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying: **He who called (people) to righteousness, there would be reward (assured) for him like the rewards of those who adhered to it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect.** And he who called (people) to error, he shall have to carry (the burden) of its sin, like those who committed it, without their sins being diminished in any respect. [Saheeh Muslim: [book 34, #6466, #6468, #6469, and #6470][2]] 

So you can get the reward of people praying&#8211;five times a day, every day! But be careful, because the sin is multiplied, too&#8211;hence the importance of quoting sources and trustworthy shuyookh.

And if you need help, tips, support, then drop by&#8211;that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about!

May Allah allow us to benefit each other and ourselves from this project, and make it a way for us to extend our deeds until the day of Judgment&#8211;Allahumma ameen!

So [check it out][1] and see what you think!

And yes, there is a &#8220;sawm&#8221; folder too, for all things fasting-related; if it&#8217;s popular, we&#8217;ll keep it, otherwise, we&#8217;ll focus insha&#8217;Allah on just salah. Please give me some feedback in the comments, too, if there are any changes you need or ideas you have.
