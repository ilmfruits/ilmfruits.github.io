**Note:** This is the third post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma.

From the [opening ceremonies][1], to the first move of world leaders, people like to send a message. The [intense revelation][2] of the Qur’an is no different. The timing, style and content, sends a message to the final Prophet (saw) and to all of humanity.

Allah (swt) starts the revelation commanding the Prophet to read **_&#8220;Recite in the name of your Lord who created.&#8221;_** The big statement? It’s all about knowledge. Allah reveals that knowledge will be the way of those who submit to him. Knowledge brings honour to our scholars and courage to our leaders. Knowledge is an Islamic tradition. The carriers of this deen understood and embraced this critical message – they embodied it.

Allah has, for his servants, put this message in context and given it some perspective. Allah instructs that all this knowledge is not an abstract pursuit of man, rather, is unconditionally linked to Himself. Allah continues, **_&#8220;Created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous.&#8221;_**

Intricate words for an intricate message. Allah mentions creation and the creation of man – separately, to show us how special we are. For us to link our pursuit of knowledge to Him we need to know Him, so Allah introduces Himself with the name Al-Aqram – the Most Generous. Who is more generous than the one: **_&#8220;Who taught by the pen. Taught man that which he knew not.&#8221;_**

The pen is mentioned because writing is a way to preserve and share knowledge. Further driving home the main message. And, to top it off, Allah gives a small hint, mentioning a &#8220;clinging substance,&#8221; a [detail of embryology][3] only recently understood. Allah shares some knowledge elucidating that all knowledge is from Allah.

The message can be unwrapped layer by layer, exposing the grace and beauty of a simple and beneficial point, is all about knowledge. This message then necessitates the question: what have we done to make knowledge the cornerstone of our life?

**Action Items:**

  * If knowledge both Islamic (and worldly), isn’t at the core of your life, shouldn’t it be? _Make a plan to increase your knowledge intake,_ for verily, as Allah has shown us, this is the place to start.
  * Comment and tell us your plan; share it, so we can all benefit, insha&#8217;Allah!
