excerpt: "Allah says: fa laa iqtahamaa al-aqabah, and he has not (rushed with great force) the (mountain) pass. This verse alludes to two great things: iqtahamaa (like Sumo wrestlers do), and one of the core values of our deen that's largely ignored by the Muslims today ..."

This is post #34 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).

Continuing our discussion of Surah Balad, Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) says:

> أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ
  
> وَلِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ
  
> وَهَدَيْنَاهُ النَّجْدَيْنِ 

**Translation:** Have We not made for him two eyes? And a tongue and two lips? And have shown him the two ways?[Surah Al-Balad, verses 8-10]

The word used for ways or paths is &#8220;najd.&#8221; Najd means a clear path, one where you can see where it&#8217;s going. Upward.

Then Allah says:

> فَلَا اقْتَحَمَ الْعَقَبَةَ
  
> وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْعَقَبَةُ 

**Translation:** But he has not broken through the difficult pass. And what can make you know what is [breaking through] the difficult pass? [verses 10-11]

When you read verse 10, the natural question that pops into your mind is &#8220;what _is_ this &#8216;aqabah, this difficult mountain pass? And verse 11 says, as we discussed very similar verses before, Allah is saying that you will **never** understand what al-&#8216;Aqabah is.

And Iqtahamaa means &#8230; if you&#8217;ve ever seen Sumo wrestling, the real part is when the two wrestlers (big muscular guys) _slam_ into each other with full power, at full force.

So Allah is giving us a clue. There&#8217;s Al-&#8216;Aqabah, the mountain pass; and you have to iqtahamaa, climb it at full-force with no holding back. If you&#8217;ve ever had to climb tons and tons of stairs&#8211;like the CN tower (pictured above, literally thousands of stairs)&#8211;you know that **to make it to the top, you need to gather your strength and rush, all at once.** You don&#8217;t climb stairs one by one and stop every few steps.

_That_&#8216;s iqtahamaa.

So we need to do iqtahamaa of Al-&#8216;Aqabah. And we&#8217;ll never understand Al-&#8216;Aqabah.

But here&#8217;s a glimpse:

> فَكُّ رَقَبَةٍ
  
> أَوْ إِطْعَامٌ فِي يَوْمٍ ذِي مَسْغَبَةٍ
  
> يَتِيمًا ذَا مَقْرَبَةٍ 

**Translation:** It is the freeing of a slave. Or feeding on a day of severe hunger, An orphan of near relationship. [verse 13-15]

Freeing a slave is something that&#8217;s not possible anymore; verse 14 says, feeding a poor person on a day of severe hunger. To feed someone poor when **you** yourself are hungry, that&#8217;s the best sadaqah you can do!

And an orphan of near kin (aka a relative of yours) is someone who has the rights of an orphan, AND the rights of near relatives; so that&#8217;s twice the rights of a regular orphan (or a regular relative).

Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) continues:

> أَوْ مِسْكِينًا ذَا مَتْرَبَةٍ

**Translation:** Or a needy person in misery. [verse 16]

In the phrase &#8220;dhaa matraba,&#8221; we see in the latter word, turaab (dirt), from taraba (the verb). This eloquently describes a person out in the elements&#8211;out with the wind and the rain, with no shelter; someone homeless, _clinging to the dirt_ out of misery.

And the final remark on Al-&#8216;Aqabah? The last thing mentioned to do?

> ثُمَّ كَانَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْمَرْحَمَةِ
  
> أُولَئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ 

**Translation:** And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion. Those are the companions of the right. [verses 17-18]

Nothing surprising here&#8211;a verse very similar to what we find in Surah Al-&#8216;Asr: believe, and call to patience, and call to rahmah (mercy, compassion). **These** are the winners, the ones who have conquered Al-&#8216;Aqabah, the people of the right.

Sounds difficult, right? Well, what&#8217;s the alternative?

> وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا هُمْ أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ
  
> عَلَيْهِمْ نَارٌ مُّؤْصَدَةٌ 

**Translation:** But they who disbelieved in Our signs &#8211; those are the companions of the left. Over them will be fire closed in. [verses 19-20]

As shaykh Muhammad Alshareef says, if a person _really, truly_ understands Hellfire, _there is no choice._ Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) describes His fire as &#8220;mu&#8217;sadah.&#8221; Mu&#8217;sadah means that the fire will _close down on you_.

People often think Hellfire is like a big plain, and there will be people running around. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s described as dark, with chained people, and with fire that is mu&#8217;sadah&#8211;closes down on you.

May Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) protect us from it and help us to understand and implement this great surah.

Really, the lesson here is that <span class="gem">social services are from the core values of Islam.</span> Praying and fasting and paying zakah and going for Hajj are what Muslims generally think about when you talk about Islam. But it&#8217;s more than just that; it&#8217;s social services, too.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala a&#8217;lam.
