excerpt: |
  Having been in Medina for so many years, Allah willed that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the Companions would return back to Makkah. Thousands marched forth to perform hajj with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that year and in that congregation he made a very important address. This was to be known as the Farewell Hajj, this was his farewell to his companions, a farewell message to the believing ummah, and in this farewell he said: "I am leaving behind two memorable things, the Book of Allah and my sunnah, whoever abides by these will never go astray."  Inshallah ta'ala listen to this little podcast, it focuses on the latter of these memorable things that the Prophet of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has left us; it will focus on the importance and the status of the Sunnah in our lives as Muslims.
