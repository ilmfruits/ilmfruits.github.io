This post is a brief and timely diversion from our tafseer series. 

Michael Jackson was one of the most popular and well-known celebrities and icons of the western world; and now, he&#8217;s dead. As Muslims, what lessons can we learn from this event? I&#8217;ve listed below some of the lessons that came to my mind:

  1. **Your Life is a Box.** The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) once drew a dot in the sand, and lines radiating out from it; he said (paraphrased), &#8220;this is the human, and their plans/desires.&#8221; To live forever, to amass huge wealth, to do this or that thing in their life &#8230; he (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) then drew a box that cut through those lines, and he said (paraphrased): &#8220;This is a human&#8217;s life.&#8221; No matter what you intend, your goals, your dreams, your hopes, when Allah pulls the plug, He pulls the plug.
  2. **Your Appointment is Already Scheduled.** If _anyone_ would&#8217;ve escaped death by virtue of wealth, or status, or love of the people, it would&#8217;ve been Jackson&#8211;but he didn&#8217;t. He was a celebrity, and perhaps one of the top celebrities; and yet, all that did nothing for him&#8211;because the appointment with Malik-al-Mawt, the angel of death, cannot be delayed even one second.
  3. **You Die Doing What You Love.** There was a statement (can&#8217;t remember the source) that malik al-mawt comes to a person when they&#8217;re doing _the thing that they love most_. If you look historically, you&#8217;ll see the validity; and here, too, it happened while Michael Jackson was planning the ultimate comeback. **This is a wake-up call to everyone who thinks they&#8217;ll repent &#8220;later.&#8221;** Later never comes; and by then, maybe your heart is already sealed from all the sins you accumulated on it. _Turn back to Allah NOW._ Don&#8217;t set yourself up to die in the midst of sins upon sins.
  4. **One Man Can Make a Difference.** Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) changed the world utterly and completely. Michael Jackson touched the lives of millions of people across the globe. Take heart from it: you, too, can make a difference in the world. So dream big, and have big goals. As Muhammad Alshareef reminded us, the reward is based on the intention&#8211;so if you intend huge, massive, amazing good deeds (with a _sincere_ intention to do them&#8211;and the proof is in the action you take towards them), then you&#8217;ll get the reward insha&#8217;Allah, whether you make it or not! How awesome is that?
  5. **Start Early.** One of the things about Michael Jackson is that he started practicing his trade at a very young age; while most people spend their time here and there, very few have the focus and willpower to remain upon one thing for hours upon hours. _If you focus, and start early, you can achieve an extremely high degree of proficiency._ As one rule of thumb says, it takes 10,000 hours (3.5 years if you work at it 8 hours a day) to become a world-class master. So choose what to work on, and start working on it!
  6. **Knowledge that Benefits.** Rumours spread upon Michael Jackson&#8217;s death about whether he&#8217;s a Muslim or not; Muslim Matters has [several posts][1] on this topic. In the end, this is a lesson that we should _learn what benefits us, and leave what doesn&#8217;t._ Are you going to witness his janaazah personally? Then what difference does it make? The fact that there are still _rumours_ about it, only guarantees that people will spend _hours and hours and hours_ reading about it. (And then we complain that we &#8220;don&#8217;t have time to read Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; hmm &#8230;)
  7. **People Forget.** At time of writing, it&#8217;s been about two and a half weeks since he died. Already, the media coverage is decreasing; within a month, a year, two, ten, hardly anybody will remember him or care anymore. This _already happened_ to so many people before us&#8211;scholars, celebrities, scientists, charitable people, even prophets, who had their teachings left behind. So then _why are we trying to earn the love of the people?_ We spend so much time and money and energy on it now, and if we disappear for even a year, we&#8217;re forgotten. So _strive for the love of Allah instead,_ because the reward of that has no ending.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam. I want to reiterate that these are my _personal reflections_ on this event; regardless, we should take benefit from those things around us, and leave what doesn&#8217;t benefit us.
