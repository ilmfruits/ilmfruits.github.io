The boy used to heal the blind and the lepers and the people. (He wasn&#8217;t a prophet: see the next post for more details.) The king&#8217;s blind companion (jalees bin malik, or the one who sits next to the king) went to the boy with gifts, and said &#8220;these are all for you if you heal me&#8221;. The boy said &#8220;Truly Allah heals. If you believe in Him, I will pray to Him, and He will heal you.&#8221; The man believed, so the boy prayed, and Allah healed the man.

Notice the boy didn&#8217;t say &#8220;**I** will heal you.&#8221; He directed it to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Partly because if he attributed it to himself, they&#8217;d worship him.

<span class="gem">Beware the power of words.</span> People **enter Islam** through words (the <span class="foreignWords">shadaha</span> &#8212; testimony of faith) and **leave Islam** through words of disbelief. **Marriage** becomes binding through words. **Divorce** occurs from use of certain words. **It&#8217;s all through words.**

The boy&#8217;s attribution of events to Allah occurs in several places in the Qur&#8217;an:

  * **Prophet Ibrahim** said: If **I** fall sick, **He** (Allah) heals me.
  * **Khidr** said: **I** defected the boat, **Allah** wanted the wall to remain standing.

And this is **the aim of da&#8217;wah:** to make certain the existence of Allah on Earth.
