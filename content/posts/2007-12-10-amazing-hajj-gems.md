Did you know:

<ol type="A">
  <li>
    The <strong>literal meaning</strong> of hajj is <strong>‘desire’</strong>? <ol>
      <li>
        Hajj is one of the main five pillars and all muslims desire to go for hajj.
      </li>
      <li>
        We should hasten to do it/plan for it as early as possible. [1]
      </li>
      <li>
        Hajj is expensive, but ALHAMDULILAH we have been given glad tidings: by the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), who said, it <strong>eliminates poverty and sin</strong>! [2]
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <li>
      <span class="gem">Those not going for hajj can earn a lot of reward and forgiveness during the hajj days</span>, as they are <strong>the best days of the year</strong>. [3] We should benefit by:
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Fasting these 10 days,</strong> especially on the 9th of dhullhijjah. [4]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sacrificing a lamb/sheep</strong> (distribute portion or all of it to needy, family members)
      </li>
      <li>
        Growing our nail/hair during these 10 days and cut them afterwards. (This also ‘unites’ us with what rest of the hajees are doing in mecca) [5]
      </li>
      <li>
        Saying Takbeer (&#8220;Allaahu akbar&#8221;), Tahmeed (&#8220;Al-hamdu Lillaah&#8221;), Tahleel (&#8220;La ilaha ill-Allaah&#8221;) and Tasbeeh (&#8220;Subhaan Allaah&#8221;) during these days. [6]
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <li>
      This is the only pillar that involves, all aspects of worship: i.e. Money/charity, physical aspects of worship, spiritual aspects of worship, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freakily enough, a hajjee without good intentions or the one who shows off, <em>may have <strong>NO HAJJ</strong></em>.
    </li></ol> 
    <p>
      May Allah forgive us and grant us an accepted hajj and highest level of paradise (Ameen wa ajma&#8217;een). Please keep us in dua’s … May Allah forgive us too (Ameen)! Please do read the relevant proofs for them, as referenced below.
    </p>

      <strong>Hadith to the above points:</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [1]: Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: “Whoever wants to go for Hajj, let him hasten to do it, because he may fall ill or some other problems may arise.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [2]: Also, hajj and umrah actually increases our blessings and wealth. The Messenger of Allaah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: “Keep on doing Hajj and ‘Umrah, for they eliminate poverty and sin just as the bellows eliminate impurities from iron and gold and silver.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 810; al-Nasaa’i, 2631. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani – may Allaah have mercy on him – in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1200).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [3]: Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these ten days.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;Not even jihaad for the sake of Allaah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Not even jihaad for the sake of Allaah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&#8221; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2/457).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [4]: &#8220;The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) used to fast on the ninth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, on the day of ‘Aashooraa’, on three days of each month, and on the first two Mondays and Thursdays of each month.&#8221; (Reported by al-Nisaa’i, 4/205 and by Abu Dawud; classified by al-Albaani as saheeh in Saheeh Abi Dawud, 2/462).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [5]:The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;When you see the new moon of Dhu’l-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he should stop cutting his hair and nails until he has offered his sacrifice.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [6]: Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &#8220;That they might witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e., reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the name of Allaah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice)&#8230;&#8221; [al-Hajj 22:28]
