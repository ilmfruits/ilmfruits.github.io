We live in an era where knowledge is abundant and is available at our finger tips in variety of formats (audio, video, ebooks&#8230;) and on variety of devices and platforms (tablets, smartphones, laptops&#8230;.). However, we lack the enthusiasm,  passion, dedication and commitment to seeking knowledge. Here are few of the inspiring stories of past to rekindle that spark.

  * Imam Zafar said &#8220;We used to sit down and take our spots for the circle of Imam Ali Madini after the Asar prayer. The circle would take place next day. We would sit all night, for fear that if we come tomorrow, we may not find a good spot to sit&#8221;  (_Subhanallah, nowadays people spend entire nights outside malls and shops to get good deals and bargains on Black Friday and Boxing Day or to meet celebrities_)
  * Salaba mentions that &#8220;I saw Ibraheem harbi in gathering, seeking knowledge Arabic language and Grammar, for 50 years, never missing out&#8221; (_Note that Salaba would have had to attend the same study circle for 50 years for him to notice Ibraheem Harbi&#8217;s dedication_)
  * Someone asked Abdur Rahman about the knowledge he benefited from father Abu Hatim, he said &#8220;My father would be eating his food and I would be reading to him&#8230; as he walks, I would read to him..he goes into washroom, and I would read to him&#8230;my father would go inside the house &#8211; looking for something &#8211; I would still be reading to him.&#8221;  Abdur Rahman then told his own story: &#8220;We were once in Egypt for studying. We had not taken any hot soup for 7 months. During the daytime, we would go from one sheikh to another, and at night, we would sit down and exchange notes. One day, we went to one of our sheikh&#8217;s circle, we were informed that sheikh is sick. On our way back, we saw a fish,  we decided to buy it. However, when we got back home, it was time to go again to yet another lecture, so we left the fish at home. That fish stayed in the same place for 3 days. When it started to rot and smell,  we decided to eat it raw&#8221;
  * One of the teachers of Bhukari mentions that &#8220;for 30 years, I never fed myself with my own hands, my sister used to put food in my mouth, I would be busy writing hadiths&#8221;.
  * Ibn Hajar said that he read the entire Bhukari in 40 hours! and Shaheeh Muslim in 4 gatherings (each gathering is like 4 hours, so in 16 hours)

More stories to follow in the next post&#8230;..Stay tuned&#8230;
