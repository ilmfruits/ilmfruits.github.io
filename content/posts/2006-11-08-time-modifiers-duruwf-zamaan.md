The Arabic language contains &#8220;time modifiers&#8221;&#8211;words like &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221;. In Arabic, these are called <dfn title="ضُرُوف زَمَان">Duruwf Zamaan</dfn>, and grammatically, they act like the [possessive case][1].

While there are tons of these in Arabic, there are two you run into pretty often in the Qur&#8217;an and ahadith: <dfn title="بَعدَ">ba&#8217;da</dfn> (after) and <dfn title="قَبلَ">qabla</dfn> (before).

Grammatically, the modifier comes before the thing it modifies&#8211;the same as in English. And since the modifier acts like the possessor in the possessive case, the modified receives kasra.

So for example, &#8220;the duck left **after** the cow&#8221; would be &#8220;<dfn title="خَرَجَت البَطَّةُ  بَعدَ البَقَرَة">kharajat al-battatu <strong>ba&#8217;da</strong> al-baqarati</dfn>ِ.&#8221; Notice the time modifier is the possessor in a possessive case&#8211;hence the word immediately after it (the possessed) takes kasra.

As another example, &#8220;he left **before** today&#8221; would be &#8220;<dfn title="ذَهَبَ قَبلَ اليَومِ">dhahaba <strong>qabla</strong> al-yawmi</dfn>.&#8221; Again, the time modifier is the possesser, and &#8220;today&#8221; is the possessed&#8211;so it takes kasra.

Also, note that the words that ARE duruwf zaman **all have fatha on the last letter**&#8211;so it&#8217;s ba&#8217;d**a**, qabl**a**, and so on.

That&#8217;s it; it&#8217;s quite simple really. If you feel you don&#8217;t understand, go back and read the [possessive case][1] post, then read this one again. Post a comment if you have any questions/comments/clarifications/etc.
