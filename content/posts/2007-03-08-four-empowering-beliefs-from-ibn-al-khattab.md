&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه), the second khalifa, had <span class="gem">four beliefs that made it easier for him to bear calamities:</span>

  1. The situation could have been worse.
  2. It didn’t strike him in his religion.
  3. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will reward him with Jannah in return inshallah.
  4. When he remembered the hardship of losing the Prophet(صلي الله عليه وسلم) everything else faded away.

Subhanallah, these are profound beliefs from the second khalifa that we can all benefit from! Reflect on them often inshallah in times of ease and hardship, until they spring to mind automatically.
