One day, the Prophet (peace be upon him) sat with his companions, early in the morning. He asked, &#8220;who among you is fasting this day?&#8221; Abu Bakr said &#8220;I am.&#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked, &#8220;who amongst you followed the funeral bier (i.e. a janaazah) today?&#8221; and Abu Bakr said &#8220;I have.&#8221; Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;who amongst you served food to the needy?&#8221; Abu Bakr said &#8220;I have.&#8221; Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;who amongst you visited a sick person today?&#8221; Again, Abu Bakr said &#8220;I have.&#8221;

Then, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **_All these four things don&#8217;t gather in one person except that Allah enters them into Paradise._** [Sahih Muslim, Book 31 / #5580]

So how would you like to earn entry into Paradise? Yes? Well then, here&#8217;s your master plan to gather the above-mentioned qualities in yourself inshallah:

  * **Fast every week,** on Mondays and Thursdays.
  * **Find some needy people,** and ensure you provide them with food.
  * **Visit any sick family members,** relatives, and/or friends. If no one is sick, mashallah! Just drop by the hospital now and then.

Once the above three qualities become regular, the day you hear of a janazah, it will be an easy task for you to try and achieve all of them! And inshallah, you&#8217;ll have them &#8216;combined&#8217; in you, just as the hadith mentions!

May Allah help us combine and instill these qualities within ourselves, that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) already mentioned as a way into Paradise, ameen!
