  When you wear Islam, wear it properly and responsibly. &#8211;A. M.
</p>

When you grow a beard or put on hijab, be aware of the responsibility. You represent the Muslims, more then ever. Represent properly!

**Don&#8217;t** mess up and appear at clubs or bars and similar places. With the greater reward comes the greater potential of punishment&#8211;you can misguide many, many people if you represent Islam improperly.

May Allah protect us from anti-da&#8217;wah.

And know that if people know you to be Muslim, regardless of how they look, they receive guidance or misguidance from your actions, your speech, your way of life, whether you know so and conciously work to guide people or not.
