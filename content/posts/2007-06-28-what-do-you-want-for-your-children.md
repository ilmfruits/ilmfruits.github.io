Most parents love their children so much &#8212; they sacrifice their time, wealth, and energy in ensuring all their children&#8217;s needs are met or surpassed! They pray for their well-being, and also plan in advance to give them the best educate them accordingly to have the best career, so they can get the best house and car. But how often do we see parents planning for their child&#8217;s deen? If we want the best in this life for our children, then why _don&#8217;t we want the best ETERNAL life for them in the akheera?_ To a regular person, this is the order for their needs:

  1. Physiological needs: food and shelter
  2. Psychological needs: friends, family and a social life.
  3. Spiritual needs: religion, belief in higher purpose of life.

Looking at the best examples in history, we find incident of when Ibrahim left his family in the barren valley of Mecca. What did Ibrahim Alayhisalam desire for them? Upon departing them, he makes the following dua to Allah:

<div class="quran">
  رَّبَّنَا إِنِّي أَسْكَنتُ مِن ذُرِّيَّتِي بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِي زَرْعٍ عِندَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُواْ الصَّلاَةَ فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِي إِلَيْهِمْ وَارْزُقْهُم مِّنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْكُرُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** &#8220;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks.&#8221; [Surah Ibrahim, verse 37]</p He does not ask for the food and shelter first, even though he leaves his family in a place without cultivation. He asks for their guidance _first and foremost_. That they worship Allah alone and establish salah. _Then_ he desires good companionship and food for them. This part of his du&#8217;a would be listed in the worldly needs. But _even when he desires for them the worldly good_, he connects his du&#8217;a to ibadah, _he requests_ from Allah to give them the fruits in this world _so that they may be **thankful** to Him! And thus obtain the reward for ibadah even then._ 

Truly, what an amazing du&#8217;a! When we make du&#8217;a for our children, THIS is what to ask for. For the best in this world, but also the best in the eternal hereafter. May Allah bless our children to obey and submit to Him alone, and make them thankful for all the blessings that are bestowed upon them (ameen).
