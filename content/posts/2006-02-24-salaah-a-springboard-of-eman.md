<p class="gem">
  Salaah is the springboard of eman. Everytime you perform salaah, your eman should go up.
</p>

In Surah Baqarah, Allah says: &#8220;And seek help in patience and prayer. Indeed it is difficult, except for those with <dfn title="humility">kushu</dfn>&#8220;.

Here are some tips inshaAllah to help you achieve awesome salaah:

  * **Pray as if it is your last prayer**. We hear imams say this a lot. But what does it mean? How would your salaah be if you knew it was your last salaah before you returned to Allah, Lord of the Worlds? It would be pretty awesome inshaAllah. Get _that_ feeling.
  * **Remember Allah&#8217;s Presence.** Remember, you&#8217;re praying in front of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). It&#8217;ll straigten out your rukuu and sujuud inshaAllah and you&#8217;ll naturally slow down.
  * **Prepare your body**
  * **Clothes:** Wear nice, clean clothes (your best, if you can)&#8211;it helps to keep something aside near your prayer area, like a nice thobe or hijab.
  * **Hunger:** Eat something beforehand if you&#8217;re hungry.
  * **Bodily Functions:** Attend to your body&#8217;s needs&#8211;don&#8217;t hold it.
  * **Miswak:** The sunnah of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was to use miswak before each salaah. Do it.
  * **wudoo:** The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) performed wudoo fresh for each salaah. Do it.

  * **Prepare your mind.**
  * **Hasten to Salaah:** Don&#8217;t delay it until only a few minutes remain. Hasten to pray as _soon_ as the time starts. Check the prayer-times ahead of time and get ready _before_ the salaah.
  * **Choose Recitation Ahead of Time:** Choose the surahs and ayat you plan to recite ahead of time. If you only know long surahs, recite a few ayat of each per rakaat, if it makes it easier.
  * **Pray When You Have Energy:** Don&#8217;t pray when you&#8217;re physically or mentally tired. It doesn&#8217;t help your concentration.

And that&#8217;s it! May Allah accept all your salaahs that you performed for His sake alone!

If you have more tips, comment them in inshaAllah. Jazakumullahu khayr.

If you can, buy the [Eman Rush Zone CD][1]. Among the traits of the sahaba and tabi&#8217;een, is that they used to weep out of fear of Allah during salaah. **How** did they do it? Well, buy the CD and find out! :D
