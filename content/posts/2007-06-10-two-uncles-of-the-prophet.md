During the 23 years of revelation, the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had many supporters and opponents, including his two uncles&#8211;Abu Talib (the father of Ali (رضالله عنه)), and <dfn title="the slave of 'Uzza">Abdul &#8216;Uzza</dfn> ibn Abdul-Muttalib, aka Abu Lahab.

Subhanallah, even within **two uncles of the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم)**, we see great differences. Compare and constrast them:

**Abu Talib:**

  * Extended his protection to his nephew, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), even though the Quresh wanted to kill him
  * Wrote strong, emotional poetry during the boycott of Mecca in order to move people towards nullifying it
  * Commanded his sons to sleep in the Prophet&#8217;s (صلي الله عليه وسلم) bed at night, so that if any assassins came, the sons would die instead of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)
  * The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said regarding him: because of me, he will be in the **lightest part of the Hellfire**.



**Abu Lahab:**

  * When the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) stood on Mount Safaa and openly called the people to Islam for the first time, Abu Lahab said **May you perish! Have you called us for _this_?**
  * Mocked the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) when his son Ibrahim died
  * Commanded his two sons, who were married to the Prophet&#8217;s (صلي الله عليه وسلم) daughters, to divorce them
  * The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said regarding him: Every nation has a Fir&#8217;awn, **and the Fir&#8217;awn of our nation is Abu Lahab** [[1][1]].

What are one of the lessons we can learn from this? <span class="gem">It doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, or who your family is&#8211;what matters are your beliefs and your deeds.</span> And Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَى وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوباً وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا <strong>إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</strong> إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ
</div>

**Translation:** O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, **the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is he who is the most righteous of you.** And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).

May Allah make us among those who achieve taqwa, irrespective of who we are&#8211;ameen!
