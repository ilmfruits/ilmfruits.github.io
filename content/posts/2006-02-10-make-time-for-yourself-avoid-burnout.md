<p class="gem">
  When you get involved in da&#8217;wah, don&#8217;t forget yourself.
</p>

We see many examples of this&#8211;people join the local MSA, and spend 40 hours a week to keep it alive. And the next year, you see them in the bar, with their girlfriend or boyfriend. Or others spend months putting together The Biggest Conference Ever, and while it goes on, they miss all the lectures and mill around outside with their friends, or out in the parking lot arguing about lunches.

<p class="gem">
  If you don&#8217;t make time for yourself, you&#8217;ll eventually burn out, and be worse off then before you started.
</p>

Don&#8217;t let it happen to you. Make sure you always spend time to learn and grow, even if it&#8217;s a little bit of time compared to all the work you do.

May Allah help you along your way and protect you from an evil end, ameen.
