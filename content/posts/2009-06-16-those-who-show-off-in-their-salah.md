excerpt: "In Surah Ma'oon, Allah says: woe to those who pray. Then he says: those who show off in their salah. And in Surah Nisaa, he comments on those who show off--the munafiqeen. So what about those who do even worse then this? And we discuss Al-Ma'oon, the small favours, the things that wouldn't even hurt you if you did them."

**Note:** This is post #19 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).

In Surah Ma&#8217;oon, Allah says:

> فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ
  
> الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ
  
> الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ
  
> وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ 

**Translation:** So woe to those who pray; those who are heedless of their prayer, those who make show [of their deeds]; And withhold [simple] assistance (al-ma&#8217;oon). [Surah Ma&#8217;oon, verses 4-7]

Allah says, &#8220;so woe to those who pray.&#8221; Don&#8217;t stop at this ayah! People who pray are not cursed by Allah! Allah continues: those who _show off_ in their prayer, &#8230;

You know what&#8217;s interesting about this ayah? What&#8217;s really, _really_ interesting about this ayah?

Do you want to know?

Are you sure?

&#8230;ok, here goes: Allah says:

> إن المنافقين يخادعون الله وهو خادعهم وإذا قاموا إلى الصلاة قاموا كسالى يراؤون الناس ولا يذكرون الله إلا قليل 

**Translation:** Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive Allah , but He is deceiving them. _And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people_ and not remembering Allah except a little &#8230; [Surah Nisaa, verse 142]

Here, Allah directly says, &#8220;the munafiqeen.&#8221; And he says: they show themselves to the people (i.e. showing off) when they pray.

And he says: they pray _lazily_.

So what about people who _don&#8217;t pray_, at all?

So if you fall into this category&#8211;even partially&#8211;you should be afraid. Very afraid. This is a very serious matter to Allah, these five-minutes you stand up and pray five times a day.

I&#8217;ve discussed this issue in more detail in my post, [The Terrible Consequences of Not Praying Salah][1]. If you pray every prayer regularly, alhamdulillah, read it and be reminded about what you&#8217;re safe from.

And if you don&#8217;t pray, read it insha&#8217;Allah; it might help you start, or if you&#8217;ve started, it might give you that extra motivational juice to jump farther in your salah.

May Allah protect us all from being those whom He has cursed as a consequence of their actions&#8211;ameen ya rabbi!

Allah continues and mentions: those who prevent al-ma&#8217;oon. What exactly is al-ma&#8217;oon, the thing that caused this surah to get its name?

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/box-of-crayons.jpg" alt="a big box of crayons" title="a big box of crayons" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1202" />

Al-Ma&#8217;oon means something small that you do, that wouldn&#8217;t even harm you to do it. Muhammad Alshareef describes it as crayons&#8211;if you ever see young kids, there might be two kids in a class; one kid has a big box of like 300 crayons with like 15 shades of blue.

So another kid pops by, &#8220;can I borrow your blue crayon?&#8221;

And the first guy looks over his box of 300 crayons and says &#8230; &#8220;no!&#8221;

_That_ is preventing al-ma&#8217;oon. The first kid could give away that crayon, and it wouldn&#8217;t even hurt him; but he doesn&#8217;t (because kids tend to not return crayons).

And of course, kids are sinless &#8230; but we are not.

One example of al-ma&#8217;oon I find is, letting people go when it&#8217;s heavy traffic and a guy wants to change lanes in front of you. It&#8217;s literally bumper-to-bumper, and the guy won&#8217;t slow you down; but people tend to speed up and not leave any space, subhanallah.

**Action Items:**

  * **What Is Al-Ma&#8217;oon?** Insha&#8217;Allah see if you can come up with some examples from your own life.
  * **Pray More.** Hit your five fard salawaat if you haven&#8217;t; if you have, fortify it with _more_ sunnah and nawaafil prayers, so you don&#8217;t even come _close_ to missing a fard salah. </ul> 
    Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
