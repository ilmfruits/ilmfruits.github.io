What exactly _is_ a hadith? It&#8217;s a saying of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). <dfn title="مُصطَلَح الحَدِيث">The Science of Hadith</dfn> defines a hadeeth as &#8220;whatever is attributed to the Prophet, in terms of sayings, actions, approvals, and physical and character descriptions.&#8221; [1]

<dfn title="The plural of hadith">Ahadith</dfn> are an important part of Islam. They complement and the Qur&#8217;an, and provide us with numerous benefits and different types of information, including:

  * Laws not directly stated in the Qur&#8217;an (eg. prohibition of visiting fortune-tellers)
  * Details of things mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an (eg. how to make wudoo)
  * A look into the lifetime of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)
  * Tafseer (explaination) of the Quran (eg. the story of the [People of the Ditch][1])

Some people **deny** ahadith, and say &#8220;we don&#8217;t need no hadiths! We can just use Qur&#8217;an!&#8221; In response, refer them to this verse:

<div class="quran">
  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ <strong>وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ</strong> وَلَا تُبْطِلُوا أَعْمَالَكُمْ
</div>

**Translation:** O you who believe! Obey Allâh, and obey the Messenger (Muhammad) and render not vain your deeds. [Surah Muhammad, 47:33]

Or, if it suits your da&#8217;wa a bit better, ask them: &#8220;how do you know how to pray?&#8221; It&#8217;s not in the Qur&#8217;an&#8211;only a few details here and there. The same goes for wudoo! (Further details are available [here][2].)

While ahadith can be classified in many ways, it&#8217;s essential that all Muslims understand the following five:

  * **Saheeh** (linguistically, &#8220;sound&#8221;): those ahadith that are certified authentic.
  * **Hassan** (linguistically, &#8220;good&#8221;): those ahadith that are lower in status then saheeh. They are usually da&#8217;eef hadith that are upgraded to Hassan due to authentic backing.
  * **Da&#8217;eef** (linguististically, &#8220;weak&#8221;) those ahadith that are likely not true and are generally not used in certain topics, such as &#8216;aqeedah. They can still be used in other fields, such as akhlaaq.
  * **Mawdoo':** Fabricated ahadith that are _definitely_ not true&#8211;someone invented them and attributed them falsely to the Prophet.
  * **Qudsi:** (linguistically, &#8220;pure&#8221;): Hadith where the Prophet narrates or paraphrases something from Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).

That includes a brief introduction to ahadith. Please post any questions/clarifications in the comments area. Jazakumullahu khayran!
