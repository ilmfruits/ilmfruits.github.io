To know your identity, know your roots.

One way to destroy a people is to isolate them from their roots.

Muslims today remain ignorant of their identity. Who was the Prophet, (صلي الله عليه وسلم)? What was he like? Who are Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Aisha, Az-Zubayr, Abu Darda? Who was Imam Shafi&#8217;ee, Imam Malik, Salahuddin (may Allah be pleased with all of them)?

So study your history! Read the seerah of the Prophet, the seerah of the Khulafa, and Islamic history &#8212; including major figures like the four imams, Salahuddin, and others.

Wallahu &#8216;alim. Any great links to articles/books/videos/lectures, comment them in inshaAllah.
