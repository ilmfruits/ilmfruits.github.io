An **asset** is anything that brings **reward** (usually income) with **little effort**. A **waqf** is an asset **donated to the Muslims** <span class="foreignWords">feasabilillah</span> (for the sake of Allah).

Looking for an **inexpensive** asset to deposit **continual good deeds** into your <span class="foreignWords">akhira</span> bank account? Try this: **purchase** an &#8216;itter bottle&#8211;one of the big oil ones&#8211;and place it somewhere in a masjid or prayer space. Or a kleenex box (especially if it&#8217;s winter or flu season). Or a book. All Muslims benefit from it, and you continue to earn the reward.

For a **minimal cost**, you reap **massive benefit**. Alhamdullilah. If you know any other inexpensive waqfs, comment them in inshaAllah. Jazakumullahu khayr.
