  Asalamu &#8216;alaikum,
</p>

Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wasalam &#8216;ala Rasool Allah.

Rifa&#8217;ah ibn Rafi&#8217; said: We were praying behind the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam and when he raised his head at the end of the rak&#8217;ah he said:

<div style="text-align: left;">
  A man behind him said:<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></p> 
  
  <p>
    </span></span></span>
  </p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center;">

To You belongs all praise, abundant good praise, inherently blessed&#8221;</span>

  <p>
    <span><span><span><br /> When he finished he asked, &#8220;Who was the speaker just now?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I was.&#8221; He, sallalahu alayhi wasalam said, <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I saw over thirty angels racing one another to be the first to record it.&#8221;</span> (Bukhari)</p>

      <p>
        This adhkar that has been accepted by the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam, thus it is a part of his sunnah (for more information on the details of sunnah click <a href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/the-status-of-the-sunnah">here</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We&#8217;ve already talked about the concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">hamd &#8212; </span>the absolute height and perfection of praise which is reserved for no one except for Allah, the one who is deserving of all praise. To Allah belongs praise, an abundant praise because of who He is, because of the fact that He is the King of all Kings, The Most Forgiving, The Most Just, the Majestic, the Most Merciful, the Most High, and all the other beautiful names and attributes which befit His Majesty. All goodness we ascribe to Allah (<span style="font-style: italic;">alhamdolilah)</span> and we reject all evil from Allah (<span style="font-style: italic;">subhanallah). </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We see the importance of this remembrance because the Prophet of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasalam tells us that the Angels, the creation of Allah, ran in numbers to record it. The Angels are a creation of Allah that have been created for the sole purpose to worship Him, subhana. There is not a hand span of four fingers in the sky where there is not an Angel in worship of Allah. These Angels will rise up from a life-time of prostration to Allah and will say, &#8220;Glory be to You! We have not worshiped you like you deserve&#8221; (for more details about the amazing creation known as Angels click <a href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/light-of-eman-session-2">here</a>). And it is the same creation of Allah, the sinless Angels, who raced for the honor of recording this specific remembrance. Make note of this importance, because you don&#8217;t hear the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam informing us about the Angels acting in a similar manner to other remembrances uttered.

        May Allah azza wa jal give us the ability to put these small remembrances into our practice and give us greater concentration in our salat
