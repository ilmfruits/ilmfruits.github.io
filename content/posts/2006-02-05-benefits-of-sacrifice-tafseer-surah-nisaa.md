In Surah Nisaa, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ اقْتُلُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ أَوِ اخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَارِكُم مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتًا<br /> وَإِذاً لَّآتَيْنَاهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّـا أَجْراً عَظِيمًا<br /> وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطًا مُّسْتَقِيمًا
</div>

**Translation:** If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, **very few of them would have done it**. But if they had done what they were (actually) told, it would have **been best for them**, and would have **gone farthest to strengthen their (faith)**. And We should then have given them from our presence a **great reward**. And We should have shown them the Straight Way. (Al-Quran, Surah Al-Nisaa, 4:66-68)<sup>1</sup>

These verses highlight the importance of sacrifice. As Muslims, we were not told to leave our homes or kill ourselves (such as the repentance perscribed for Bani Israeel&#8211;see Surah Baqarah). Had it been perscribed on us, **few of us would have done it.**

About the hadith of the Prophet (sallahu alayhi wa sallam) &#8220;Whoever gives something up for the sake of Allah, Allah replaces it with something better,&#8221; the scholars say the replacement could be in **the dunya _and_ the akhira.** Subhanallah.

Although sacrifice seems like it isn&#8217;t in your best interests&#8211;you sacrifice your wealth, your time, your life, or something else&#8211;the results are that it **strengthens eman** and Allah rewards you for it.

When you sacrifice and see no results, rememeber: it&#8217;s for the sake of Allah, and the rewards are in the hereafter. Results are important, but don&#8217;t give up if you see no results.

Also, results should get you closer to Allah, not farther. If you find they don&#8217;t, Allahu &#8216;alim, it may be that your intentions are not 100% straight.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
