Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wassalam &#8216;ala rasool Allah

Continuing in the ten ways to achieve the love of Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala, here are the last five points as per ibn al-Qayyim rahimuhallauh:

> Sixth, observing Allaah’s kindness, goodness and bounties, both hidden and open.

It is to be aware of the vast amounts of Mercy Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has engulfed His slaves with. It is to recognize and accept the blessings of Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and to show thanks for it. As Allah says: &#8220;<span id="verse_4919_language_7_content">Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinns and men) deny?&#8221; [Surah Rehman V.13]</span>

> Seventh, and this is the most wonderful, the heart being soft, subdued and meek before Allaah.
> 
> Eighth, being alone with Allaah during the time when the Lord descends during the last portion of the night while reading His Book and ending that by asking for forgiveness and repenting.

Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an, the meaning of which is: &#8220;<span id="verse_2108_language_7_content">And in some parts of the night (also) offer the Salat (prayer) with it (i.e. recite the Quran in the prayer), as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer Nawafil) for you (O Muhammad SAW). It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqaman Mahmuda (a station of praise and glory, i.e. the highest degree in Paradise!)&#8221; [17:79]</span>

<span>Imam as-Suyooti rahimuhallah says in his tafsir of this verse: <em>&#8220;It may be that your Lord will raise you to, establish you, in the Hereafter in a praiseworthy station, one for which the first and last [of mankind] will praise you — and this is the station of intercession [which will take place] during [the passing of] the Final Judgement&#8221;</em></span>

<span>Much can be said about the blessings of the night prayer. It is sufficient though for our purpose to quote the hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah radhiAllah anhu in which the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam said (the meaning of which is): &#8220;</span><span>Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night, inquiring: ‘Who will call on Me so that I may respond to him? Who is asking something of Me so I may give it to him? Who is asking for My forgiveness so I may forgive him?'&#8221;<br /> </span><span><br /> Truly, those who regularily commit to praying in the last third of the night, they are the successful ones. We ask Allah to make us amongst the blessed people who can reach that status.</span>

> Ninth, sitting with the beloved and sincere, benefitting from the most fruitful of their speech. And not to speak unless speaking is more beneficial and you know that it will improve your state and be beneficial to others.
> 
> Tenth, remaining away from every cause that comes between the heart and Allaah

In a hadith collected  by Imam Bukhari rahimuhallah and narrated by Nu’man ibn Bashir radhiAllah anhu, the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam said: “…Beware, in the body there is a flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt, and behold, it is the heart.&#8221;

The purity of this heart is directly linked to the actions of the heart, the limbs, and the statements of the tongues because these are the three means of sinning. With every sin the Son of Adam commits his _eman_ diminishes and his heart gets dirtier.

In regards to the heart, some of the _salaf_ used to say: “The heart is the king of the limbs and the rest of the limbs are its soldiers; they always obey him by implementing his instructions and they never disobey him in any regard.  (Remember) when the king is pious, his soldiers will also be pious.  Similarly, when the king is sinful, his soldiers will also be sinful.”

May Allah shower us with a blessed journey towards attaining His Love. Ameen.
