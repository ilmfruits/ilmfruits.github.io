Is futures trading halal or haram? Futures trading isn&#8217;t just for investors&#8211;even day-to-day transactions like buying and selling fruit, furniture, or funky gadgets can take the same ruling!

So is it halal? Or haram?

What exactly _are_ futures? Futures trading generally apply to stocks, indexes, etc. Say you&#8217;re trading currencies (such as the Japanese Yen). Normal trading is buying high and selling low; futures trading is &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell you 1000 Yen at this price, two months from today, and you pay me then.&#8221; An option to buy later at a specific price guaranteed now, which you pay for later.

For the sake of simplification, you can consider it as a contract to buy furniture from your aunt, who buys and sells antique furniture. She tells you &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell you an antique wooden chest next week for $350. Pay me next week.&#8221; That&#8217;s what futures is.

How does it measure up, Islamically?

  * **Selling what you don&#8217;t have possession of:** Futures is generally a debt-inducing contract; the buyer sells you something they don&#8217;t have (but intend to buy at a cheap price). Sometimes, the commodity being sold doesn&#8217;t exist, and _it may exist_ later on (at the date of the contract). In either case, the buyer is selling something that they don&#8217;t own! And that&#8217;s not permissible in Islam!
  * **Debt for debt:** Even if you own the commodity in the exchange that you&#8217;re selling (or buying) in a futures contract, it becomes a debt for a debt. You owe some money, and the seller owes some commodity. Again, not permissible.

So how can we make a futures contract halal? How can we tackle these issues?

  1. **Buy and sell what exists.** Make sure that, whatever the commodity is, be it stocks, or currency, it already exists in the world.
  2. **Make it a promise, not a transaction.** If you consider the deal a legally binding transaction, then it&#8217;s haram; but if it&#8217;s just a promise to buy at a later date (spiritually, but not legally, binding) then it becomes permissible. Practically, this means you CAN (but shouldn&#8217;t) back out of the deal when the time comes; and that you cannot take to court, in an Islamic system, the other party.
  3. **Pay a deposit.** Another solution to the debt-for-debt transaction is to pay a down-payment up-front; at least then, something has exchanged hands, and it&#8217;s not a debt-for-debt transaction anymore, but a proper, legally-binding transaction.
  4. **No reselling.** If you bought a futures contract and paid money, that contract entitles you to some commodity. Can you resell that commodity? No! Because you don&#8217;t physically have possession of it!

However, why are futures haram? One of the goals of shari&#8217;ah is to prevent thulm; and with futures, the wisdom of prohibition may be around not being able to provide what you sell &#8212; if you promise someone you&#8217;ll sell them something, and you can&#8217;t deliver, then what?

There&#8217;s a relevant hadith about a man who came to rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;People ask me to sell them things I don&#8217;t have. Should I say yes, and go buy them?&#8221; and the messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;No, go buy them first, and then sell them.&#8221;

On the other hand, he (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) permitted farmers to sell their future crops before they were planted! You might say, &#8220;What the?!&#8221;

Look again at the wisdom of prohibition &#8212; not being able to provide what you don&#8217;t have. In the case of farmers, they are capable of providing it (albeit at a somewhat uncertain quality or quantity), and the money would help them now to generate crops &#8212; so they are exempted from the prohibition of futures.

And from this hadith, scholars derive a rule: if you are a **primary producer or manufacturer of an item,** you can sell it before it&#8217;s manufactured or produced. So the issue of house builders selling houses based on blueprints? It would be permissible insha&#8217;Allah.

But _you can&#8217;t resell that!_&#8211;Because you&#8217;re not the primary manufacturer!

And that&#8217;s futures contracts, in a nutshell. To summarize:

  1. **Don&#8217;t deal in futures.** It&#8217;s a fickle thing. Especially if you don&#8217;t understand the fiqh.
  2. **Consult your local (knowledgeable) imam.** They can tell you what to do.
  3. **You can initiate futures contracts,** provided the commodity exists and the seller possesses it.
  4. **Give or pay a down payment,** to avoid a debt-for-debt transaction.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
