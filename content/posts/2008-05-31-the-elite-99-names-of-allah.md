Having already discussed the unlimited number of Allah&#8217;s names and attributes, we turn now to an authentic hadith that seems to clash with what we said before.

The Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:

<div class="arabicHadith">
  إِنَّ لِلَّهِ تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا مِائَةً إِلاّ وَاحِدًا مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ .
</div>

**Translation:** Indeed, Allah has 99 names (one hundred minus one); whoever memorizes them will enter Jannah. [Saheeh Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim]

This hadith is talking about the _elite_ 99 names of Allah. Although all of Allah&#8217;s names are husna, some of them stand out above others.

So which names are the elite 99? Virtually every single scholar of Islam has a different opinion on this. And realize that the common version that we know&#8211;like the one in [this nasheed][1]&#8211;is da&#8217;eef.

Why is it da&#8217;eef? It comes from the same hadith as we stated above&#8211;except at, at some point, one narrator added &#8220;And this is what _I think_ those names are.&#8221; So it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s opinion.

And realize that most of the names they&#8217;ve mentioned there are ok&#8211;but some are definitely negative (which goes against Allah&#8217;s names being husna), and some are definitely not Allah&#8217;s names.

But the good thing is, about 80-90% of the names there are ok. And even among the scholars of Islam, they agree on the vast majority of which names are THE elite 99&#8211;but they differ in a few names.

And why is this important to know&#8211;aside from for tawassul? Because this is your key to jannah! Another wording of this hadith, instead of using hadifha (to memorize, to protect), uses the word &#8220;hisaa&#8221; (with saad). The root word has something to do with intelligence and intellect; the meaning is that _whoever knows and acts upon these names_ will enter Jannah.

Having said all that&#8211;if these 99 names are so important, _why didn&#8217;t Allah just **tell us** which are His 99 names?_

But think about it&#8211;if He (سبحانه وتعالى) told us&#8211;would anyone bother with the other names? Probably not. Would anyone try to investigate the meanings of and learn the names? Not really&#8211;we&#8217;d just have a common list of names passed around, and nobody would do more than memorize.

Instead, by not telling us, He (سبحانه وتعالى) _has created a situation like Laylatul-Qadr._ Nobody knows when Laylatutl-Qadr is, except Allah&#8211;so people **strive the last ten days of Ramadan**, doing extra nawafil acts, in the hopes that it&#8217;s Laylatul-Qadr.

And these elite 99 names are like that&#8211;you have to work hard, and strive above and beyond just learning 99, if you want to know them for sure.

So learn these names&#8211;with their meanings! Subhanallah, _nothing_ will increase your eman quite like this will.

To start you off, you can check our List of Allah&#8217;s Names post, and also check [God Names][2], a site that details 99 names, with a great explanation of meaning.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) help us to learn and memorize and act upon His 99 names, and become those of Jannah by it&#8211;ameen ya rabbi!
