  Abu Barzah al-Aslami radi Allahu anhu reported that Allah’s Messenger sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam said, “The two feet of the servant will not cease (from standing before Allah) on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about four things: on his life and how he spent it; on his knowledge and what he did with it; on his wealth and where he earned it and how he spent it; and on his body and in what way he utilized it.” [Saheeh, reported by At-Tirmidhi]
</h4>

We live in a time where it is difficult to truly imagine ourselves being under anyone else&#8217;s control, even though we know our every breath, our every step, our every movement is fully controlled by the Creator of the heavens and the Earth. Nonetheless, we still find it difficult to imagine a day where freedom will be taken away, completely. Today, even under these &#8216;controlled&#8217; environments, Allah has permitted freedom to mankind; we can speak, eat, see, walk, sit, touch, and listen as we please. However, in the Hereafter on the Day of Judgement, the freedom of mankind will indeed be taken away and the supremacy of Allah subhanhu wa ta&#8217;ala will be shown. On that Day, Allah will reign King over all the other so-called kings and humans, and He will control His environment in a matter that He wills. On that Day, we will not cease from standing until certain questions are answered.

How many of us are able to actualize the reality of this event? Just imagine not having the ability to move even the slightest bit on that day. Imagine&#8230;feet being stuck to the ground and not having the ability to lift them, even with full attempts to do so. Just imagine, with all the anxiety, stress and fear of that day, you will stand in front of Allah and He will directly ask you about four things: 1) Your life 2) Your knowledge 3) Your wealth 4) Your body

There will be no escaping on that day in front of Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. We will be asked and we will answer; whether we like it or not, whether the answers are pleasing or not. Let&#8217;s push and struggle to be of those whose answers will be pleasing to Him, subhana. Let&#8217;s make the sincere intention to make our **lives** a means to come closer to Allah, let&#8217;s use the **knowledge** we gain to worship Him in a manner that befits His majesty, let&#8217;s use our **wealth** to give zakat and charity, and let&#8217;s use our **bodies** to do all kinds of good deeds for His sake.
