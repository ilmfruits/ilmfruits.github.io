This Ramadan…be an orange!

_Say what?_

> &#8220;The example of a believer, who recites the Qur&#8217;an and acts on it, is like an **orange** (_utrujjah_) which tastes nice and smells nice.
> 
> And the example of the believer who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an but acts on it is like a **date** that tastes sweet but has no smell.
> 
> And the example of the hypocrite who recites the Quran is like a **sweet basil** which smells good but tastes bitter.
> 
> And the example of a hypocrite who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an is like a **colocynth** (bitter apple) which tastes bitter and has a bad smell.&#8221;
> 
> [Allah’s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم), reported in Saheeh al-Bukhari]

Subhan Allah!

So, in sha Allah, we should all strive to be like the believer who is like an orange: the one who is emanating beauty because of his/her attachment to the Qur&#8217;an. And may Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) protect us from being like the hypocrites, ameen!
