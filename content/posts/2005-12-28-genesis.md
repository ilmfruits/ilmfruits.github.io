Today, I created my new blog. I hope, by the permission of Allah, you will all learn and grow and benefit from it. For more information on what it is and why it exists, check the About page.

Feedback can only make you stronger.

I borrow from the inaugaration speech of Abu Bakr as-Siddique, radiallahu &#8216;ahn. He said: &#8220;Support me, if I am in the right, and correct me if I am in the wrong.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> So if you find anything great, then it is from Allah, and share it. And if you find anything incorrect, let me know so I can correct it. And remember, the best muhasaba (accountability) is _private_.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
