excerpt: 'We live in a world in which the concept of haya between man and women is lost. We forget that at every step Shaytaan waits to pounce, to guide us to evil. Living in the West, going to University, we see a lot of evil, and we see the plan of Shaytaan at work; Muslim men and Muslim women forgetting their boundaries and falling into the fitnah of society. Every wonder what would happen if you die in a state of disobedience to Allah? Will your heart every truly be satisfied by disobeying Allah Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)? Come to The Guide! Come to Allah, purely, sincerely.  Listen to the podcast and learn about this much-forgotten issue.'
