Continuing our study of the fruits of <dfn title="faith">eman</dfn>, here are some additional fruits that spring from the tree of eman:

<div class="miniTitle">
  9) Good Always Happens to You
</div>

In one hadith, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;How amazing is the situation of the believer. His affair is always for the best, and this is not true for anyone besides the believer. If good befalls him he is thankful and this is best for him. If ill befalls him he is patient and this is best for him.&#8221; [Sahih Muslim]<sup>?</sup>

What does it mean? A Muslim is never a loser. He always has good happen to him. Alhamdullilah.

<div class="miniTitle">
  10) A Gateway from Sorrows
</div>

In Surah Talaq, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا
</div>

**Translation:** Such is the admonition given to whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day. And for those who fear Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him. (Surah Talaq, verse 2)<sup>2<br /> </sup>

Whoever has eman and taqwa, Allah makes an escape route for him from his worries and problems. So a believer is never trapped&#8211;financially, socially, marital problems&#8211;no problem! Allah says, if you fear/worship Me, I will make a way out for you from a way you did not suspect would be able to help. Subhanallah.

<div class="miniTitle">
  11) Raised up Here and in the Hereafter
</div>

In Surah Mujadila, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ
</div>

**Translation:** Allah will rise up, to (suitable) ranks (and degrees), those of you who believe and who have been granted Knowledge (Surah Mujadila, verse 11)<sup>2</sup>

Those who believe (and have eman) will be raised up to high ranks, in this life and in the hereafter.

<div class="miniTitle">
  12) Protection from Falling into Evil
</div>

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;A person who commits zina, while doing it, is not Muslim. A person who drinks alcohol, while doing it, is not Muslim. A person who plunders from the booty, while doing it, is not Muslim.&#8221; [Sahih Muslim]<sup>?</sup>

Why isn&#8217;t he a Muslim? Because if he had eman, he wouldn&#8217;t be doing those things. We know, from other ahadith, that while he commits these acts, his eman leaves his heart, and when he finishes, enters in a diminshed state. And notice, these three things mentioned, are not just ordinary sins. They are _big_ sins.

May Allah increase our eman and protect us from kufr, shirk, and nifaq.
