The king&#8217;s companion pointed out the boy.

Why didn&#8217;t he remain silent? For that matter, why does the boy point out the monk later?

Resolve. Ibn Tamiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said <span class="gem">&#8220;much of your resolve disappears when tortured&#8221;</span>. Your determination and strength of will plummets. So the man pointing out the boy, well, his determination couldn&#8217;t withstand the torture.

So the king&#8217;s soldiers brought the boy to the king, who said &#8220;O my boy, your magic heals the blind and cures the lepers &#8230;&#8221; Then he used flattery. &#8220;O my boy, you&#8217;re soooooooooooo cool.&#8221; And when you flatter someone with pride in their heart, they become deluded. <span class="gem">Pride makes you succeptible to delusion.</span>

But the boy had too much eman. He said &#8220;I don&#8217;t heal, Allah heals&#8221;. [Sound familiar?][1]

Eventually, the king realized he wasn&#8217;t getting anywhere, and tortured the boy. The boy&#8217;s willpower failed, and he pointed out the scholar.

The king said to the monk/scholar &#8220;renounce your religion&#8221;. The scholar refused. So they brought a large saw and sawed him vertically in half.

Why, you ask, didn&#8217;t the king try flattery? Because the scholar is a person of knowledge, and therefore, protected from false tricks and flattery. People of knowledge see right through that. <span class="gem">People of knowledge cannot be confused by misinformation.</span>

Similarly, when Abu Dhar, may Allah be pleased with him, proclaimed shahada, the Meccans beat him with intention to kill. But Al-Abbas stepped in and said &#8220;By Allah, if you kil him, none of your caravans will be safe.&#8221; This incident is narrated in [Bukhari][2] 4/56/724. Read about the [first beating][3].
