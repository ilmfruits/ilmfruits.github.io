  The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) asked Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) for His protection from shirk. So why do <em>we</em> act like we <em>know</em> we&#8217;ll die Muslim?
</p>

Remember, this is the Prophet of Allah. He spoke to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) without any barrier. He received revelation directly from Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). He is the best of creation.

So seek protection in Allah from shirk, the unforgivable sin that destroys good deeds. The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us the following du&#8217;a:

<img alt="Du'a for Shirk" id="image206" src="/wp-content/uploads/dua-protection-from-shirk.gif" />
  
**Transliteration:** Allaahumma &#8216;innee &#8216;a&#8217;oo<u>th</u>u bika &#8216;an &#8216;ushrika bika wa &#8216;anaa &#8216;a&#8217;lamu, wa &#8216;astaghfiruka limaa laa &#8216;a&#8217;lamu.

**Translation:** O Allah, I seek refuge in You lest I associate anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for what I know not.
