If you have multiple skills and multiple interests, how can you determine the _best_ use of your skills for da&#8217;wah? Try this method inshaAllah.

  1. **Skills:** List all your skills.
  2. **Ummah:** Prioirtize the needs of the ummah (i.e. your community).
  3. **Map and Prioritize:** Tie each skill to an action, and prioritize according to need.

For example, if your skills are **writing, graphic design**, and **drama,** and your ummah needs **youth involvement** and **education**, you may decide to:

  * Start a youth-oriented **newsletter** which focuses on one area (eg. tafseer, stories of companions, etc.)
  * Write and direct short scripts for **Islamically-themed skits or movies**, such as [Halaqa Police][1]
  * Create **posters** for Islamic events that cater to youth

And so on. May Allah help you in your struggle for His path, ameen.
