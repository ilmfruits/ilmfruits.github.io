excerpt: "The People of the Ditch--Allah testifies three times, and then says, they are cursed and destroyed. Why? Because of what they did--that they burned the believers. But there's a lesson here that can apply to us--what can we do, today, that will earn us the same fate? Allah tells us."

This is post #27 in our series on Tafseer of Juz ‘Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).

Allah says, in Surah Al-Burooj:

> وَالسَّمَاءِ ذَاتِ الْبُرُوجِ
  
> وَالْيَوْمِ الْمَوْعُودِ
  
> وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ
  
> قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ 

**Translation:** By the sky containing great stars. And [by] the promised Day. And [by] the witness and what is witnessed. Cursed were the companions of the trench. [Surah Al-Buruj, verses 1-4]

The story of Ashaab-ul-Burooj, the People of the Ditch, is pretty well-known; in fact, we have an [entire 15-part series][1] on this surah. Check it out insha&#8217;Allah.

Allah opens this surahs with testifications. Then he testifies: qutila ashaabul-&#8216;uqdood. &#8216;uqdood is another word for ditch. Qutila, literally, means &#8220;they were killed.&#8221; But Ibn Abbaas (radiallahu anhu) said, whenever you read qutila in the Qur&#8217;an, it means lu&#8217;ina&#8211;cursed.

**Allah cursed the People of the Ditch.** And Allah is not in need of cursing&#8211;He can do anything, to anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lu&#8217;ina means, they were destroyed.

And they _are_destroyed.

So what great sin did they perpetrate in order to deserve this immense reward&#8211;not only being cursed and destroyed, but _being documented in the Qur&#8217;an, to be recited until the end of time_?

Let&#8217;s see.

Allah continues:

> إِذْ هُمْ عَلَيْهَا قُعُودٌ
  
> وَهُمْ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ شُهُودٌ 

**Translation:** When they were sitting near it. And they, to what they were doing against the believers, were witnesses. And they resented them not except because they believed in Allah , Al-Aziz, Al-Hamid [Surah Burooj, verses 6-8]

They were **burning the believers with fire.** Burning with fire is bad enough. Burning _believers_ is worse. And not only that, _they were sitting around, watching this happen._ Witnessing what was happening.

Imagine that. It&#8217;s like Mecca&#8211;you see someone say &#8220;Laa ilaaha illa Allah&#8221; today, and tomorrow, you see them cooking in the sun with a pile of rocks on top of them&#8211;like Bilal radiallahu &#8216;anhu. Or you see them cut to pieces, like Sumaya radiallahu &#8216;anhaa.

Or, as with the people of the ditch&#8211;you see them **thrown into a big bonfire and burned alive**. While everybody else sits around watching with a bag of popcorn.

How would that make you feel? Would you publicly declare your Islam, knowing your flaming, torturous death was only around the corner?

And this intensified the punishment&#8211;that the believers saw this happening, saw it would happen to them, but couldn&#8217;t do _a single thing_ about it. Subhanallah.

And so they were destroyed.

And then, a couple verses later, Allah says:

> إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُوبُوا فَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ الْحَرِيقِ

**Translation:** Indeed, those who have _tortured_ the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire. [Surah Burooj, verse 10]

The word _fatanuw_, translated here as tortured, means &#8230; fitnah! You can see that it&#8217;s the root word of fitnah. Fitnah, meaning to trial someone, to test them. You can also translate it as &#8220;Indeed, those who put to trial the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have **the punishment of Hell**, and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire.&#8221;

And this is a lesson for all of us. <span class="gem">Don&#8217;t put believers on trial. Don&#8217;t test them.</span> Why? Because Allah connects this to Hellfire.

Sometimes, we see people who start learning, doing this. They ask people, &#8220;what&#8217;s your opinion on this?&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8217;s your opinion on that?&#8221; Why? Not out of seeking knowledge; but to slap a label on them and put them under a fitnah.

Don&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s very, very dangerous.

And Allah issues another warning two verses later:

> إِنَّ بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ لَشَدِيدٌ

**Translation:** Indeed, the vengeance (_batsh_) of your Lord is severe. [Surah Burooj, verse 12]

Batsh means, an extremely harsh yanking or pulling. There&#8217;s a story Muhammad Alshareef related, of a man in Egypt, who used to torture Muslims. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/pickup-truck.jpg" alt="pickup-truck" title="pickup-truck" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1350" />

This man used to say, &#8220;bring your Lord, and I&#8217;ll punish Him, too.&#8221; One day, he was driving on the highway, behind a semi-truck/pickup-truck. The truck slammed on the brakes; this guy was too slow on the reflexes, and his car **slammed** into the back of the semi. It was totaled.

But not just that; the truck had in it **long poles of steel.** When the guy hit it, they flew into the car and **ripped him to pieces.** The police said, &#8220;we had to take him out piece by piece,&#8221;&#8211;cut a piece off, take it out; cut a piece off, take it out &#8230;

Again, <span class="gem">whoever puts believers on trial is risking Hellfire.</span> So don&#8217;t let that be you.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
