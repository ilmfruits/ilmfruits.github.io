Abu Hurayrah relates that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak a good word or remain silent. And whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should show hospitality to his neighbor. And whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should show hospitality to his guest.&#8221; [Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim] 

_Speak good, or stay silent
  
Treat your guest, and don’t be violent
  
Remember the meeting with your Lord, the Most High
  
Respect your neighbour, before you die_

May Allah make us among those who believe in and follow His message and His prophet in all things, ameen!
