The king asked the boy to renounce his religion, to which the boy refused. The king said &#8220;take him to the highest mountain and if he doesn&#8217;t renounce by the time you reach the top, throw him off.&#8221;

Why not saw him in half? Because the boy&#8217;s **useful**. He has **influence** among the poeple. People love him, and if _he_ joins the king, many will follow his example.

So they took him up, and the boy said &#8220;O Allah, suffice me against them in whatever way You please&#8221;. So the mountain rumbled, and everyone fell off and died. Except the boy.

**Sincere** dua, **immediate** response. The boy had yaqeen.

He walked back to the king.

The king said &#8220;What happened to your companions?&#8221; and the boy said &#8220;Allah sufficed them&#8221;.

Now, the king&#8217;s at a cross-roads: he can realize this boy is special, and follow him, or refuse. And out of arrogance, he refused. His arrogance led to more crime. He ordered another set of soldiers to take the boy to the middle of the sea, and if he didn&#8217;t renounce by that time, drown him.

Same thing happened, same du&#8217;a, they all drowned except the boy.

He walked back to the king.

**Why** did he go back? Why not just run away, or go to another land? Because he realized his purpose&#8211;to give da&#8217;wah to the people, _no matter what_.

<p class="gem">
  So ask yourself: How can I best serve Allah? <a href="/the-best-use-of-your-skills-for-dawah/">Find your purpose</a> on Earth, and stick to it. Don&#8217;t run from it.
</p>

The boy knew it, and he did exactly that.
