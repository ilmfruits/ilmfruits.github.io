For those of you studying <dfn title="the Arabic language">al-lugatul arabiyyah</dfn>, inshallah here is an easy visual way to learn six basic colours: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. (You can set it as your computer desktop, so every time you pop onto your computer, instant practice!)

The top colour is the mascline form, and the bottom colour is the feminine form. (Read more about [Arabic word gender here][1].)
