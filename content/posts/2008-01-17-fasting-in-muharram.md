excerpt: "The month of Muharram is upon us! One great sunnah of this month is to fast the day of Ashoora, as well as the day before it--the 9th and 10th of Muharram.  The reward for this is expiation of sins of the previous year, according to a hadith in Saheeh Muslim.  And don't sin!  The sin is multiplied in this month, too."

Bismillah.

The sacred month of Muharram is now upon us, and a new year has begun alhamdulillah. InshaAllah I wanted to remind you all and myself of the great sunnan this month has for us:

Rasulllah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;The best of fasting after Ramadaan is the month of Allah, Muharram, and the best of prayer after the obligatory prayers is prayer at night (qiyaam al-layl).&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim, #1163]

This month contains the day of Ashoora, which, like the day of Arafah, expiates the past years sins. The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Fast the day of &#8216;Arafah, and I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year before it and the year after it. And fast the day of Ashoora, and I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year that came before it.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim, #1162]

For more information about fasting in Muharram and Ashoora, visit [this IslamQA question][1].

We are also recommended to fast the day before Ashoora (which is the 10th of Muharram), the day known as Tasoo&#8217;a (the 9th of Muharram).

Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضالله عنه) said: When the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) fasted on the day of &#8216;Ashoora and told the people to fast, they said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, this is a day that is venerated by the Jews and Christians.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;Next year, if Allah wills, we will fast on the ninth day.&#8221; But by the time the following year came, the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had passed away. [Saheeh Muslim, #1916]

The scholars state many additional reasons why we should fast the 9th; for more information, [click here][2]. 

In these sacred months, sinning should be controlled, because sinning in these months is greater than sinning in the other months; because Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُحِلُّواْ شَعَآئِرَ اللّهِ وَلاَ <strong>الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ</strong>
</div>

**Translation:** O you who believe! Do not violate the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, **nor of the sacred month**. [Surah Maida, verse 2]

(Two things Allah prohibited in this month, because of their sanctity, is to fight in battles, and sinning.)

And, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;The division of time has returned as it was when Allah created the Heavens and the earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred: Three are in succession, (they are:) Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram; and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar, which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; [Saheeh Bukhari]

May Allah accept all of our fasting and ibadaat, ameen!
