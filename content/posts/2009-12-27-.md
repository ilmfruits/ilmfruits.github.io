Bismillah walhamdolilah wassalatu wassalam &#8216;ala rasool Allah

Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an (the meaning of which is):

[66:10]
  
Lessons:

&#8211; no one will be the aid for you on that day, not even your closest family members
  
&#8211; the prophets were tried with their closest families turnign against them (wives, also the prophets sallalahu alayhi wasalam uncles)
