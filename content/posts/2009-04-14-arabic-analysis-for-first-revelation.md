excerpt: We cover the meaning of several Arabic words and constructs in the first five ayaat of Surah Iqraa. Word-for-word is pretty common, so we jump around (instead of doing every word), and go beyond translation, into grammatical structures and what they mean.

**_This is the second post in our series of Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma._**

The first five ayaat of Surah Iqraa are:

> اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ
  
> خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ
  
> اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الْأَكْرَمُ
  
> الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ
  
> عَلَّمَ الْإِنسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ 

Word-for-word translations are pretty common these days (like [this one][1], which has Surah Iqraa), so I&#8217;m going to touch lightly on that, and do a bit more grammar. Ready? Here goes!

  * **Iqraa (اقْرَأْ):** Arabic has three types of verbs: past tense (he recited), present tense (he recites), and commands (recite!) Iqraa is a **command** to recite. (For all you nerds, it&#8217;s in baab one.) So Allah is COMMANDING us to read and recite.
  * **Rabbuka or rabbika?** In verse 1, Allah says &#8220;rabbika&#8221;; and in verse 3, Allah says &#8220;rabbuka.&#8221; What&#8217;s the difference between these two, in meaning? **Nothing!** Rabbuka, rabbika, and rabbaka all mean _the exact same thing_. (They&#8217;re just different cases of grammar.)
  * **Rabbika (رَبِّكَ):** Rabb in Arabic means the one who created you, who sustains you, who provides for you; the definition of this word takes pages! The &#8220;ka&#8221; hear means you (single person, male); so rabbuka means &#8220;your Rabb,&#8221; kitaabuka means &#8220;your book,&#8221; masjiduka means &#8220;your masjid,&#8221; etc.
  * **Khalaqa (خَلَقَ):** Khalaqa means &#8220;he created;&#8221; In fact, khalaqa means created _from nothing_. Only Allah can create out of nothing&#8211;humans just take existing &#8220;stuff&#8221; and recompose it. That&#8217;s not khalaqa; only ALLAH can create from nothing.
  * **Wa (وَ):** Wa means and. Occasionally, you may see am (أم), which is the same as wa, except am is used in questions.
  * **&#8216;Allama (عَلَّمَ):** &#8216;Allama means &#8220;he taught.&#8221; It appears in quite a few places in the Qur&#8217;an, so it&#8217;s a good word to know. The words &#8216;ilm (knowledge), mu&#8217;allim (teacher), &#8216;aalim (scholar), &#8216;ulamaa (scholars) all come from the same root&#8211;the letters &#8216;ayn, laam, and meem.

That should shed some light, insha&#8217;Allah, on the meaning of this verse.

**Action Steps:**

  * **Memorize these five ayaat!** With this [word-for-word translation][1], and some of the material above, you have no excuse left! Just memorize by meaning.
  * **Comment when you&#8217;ve memorized these five.** When you&#8217;ve completed memorizing the ayaat, walhamdulillah, post a comment and share it with the community! Together, insha&#8217;Allah, we&#8217;ll build up our knowledge + understanding + action + memorization of these surahs.
