Continuing our study of the fruits of <dfn title="faith">eman</dfn>, here are some additional fruits that spring from the tree of eman:

<div class="miniTitle">
  13) A Good Life
</div>

In Surah Nahl, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a new Life, a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actions. (Surah Nahl, verse 97)<sup>1<br /> </sup>

<p class="gem">
  Eman beings blessings into this world. And only Muslims can truly enjoy this world.
</p>

Muslims know about paradise and the different levels and things, but many of us also fail to realize that the blessings begin _here_, in _this_ life.

If you look at non-Muslims, they&#8217;re never satisfied, no matter how much they get&#8211;they always want more and more and more, and the little they have, they&#8217;re afraid to lose. (Have you ever heard of someone who reached a certain point in their wealth where they said &#8220;ok, that&#8217;s enough for me&#8221;?&#8211;never!)

Interestingly, $400-million is the mark&#8211;the point at which a person can buy anything they want. After that, if someone earns more money, there&#8217;s no more stuff to buy. But **the quality of life of the person is the same**. Of those people who have over $400M in personal holdings (and there are quite a few), not _one_ of them says &#8220;let me retire in peace&#8221;. They want more, and think&#8211;and this is a common misconception&#8211;that money **necessitates** happiness. **Wrong.**

The real <dfn title="believer/Muslim">mu&#8217;min</dfn> remains content no matter what he has&#8211;even if it&#8217;s $1, he says &#8220;alhamdullilah&#8221; and spends it on himself and his family. He remains content because he knows Allah will give him more. As for what he doesn&#8217;t have, Allah knows best about it.

<span class="gem">The highest suicide rates are in &#8220;civilized&#8221; first-world countries.</span> It&#8217;s the multimillionaires who watch the stock-market crash and commit suicide because of the millions they lose. A farmer, if you give him $1M, he won&#8217;t know what to do with it.

The mu&#8217;min&#8217;s quality of life is incomparable. And it&#8217;s not in wordly posessions, it&#8217;s in attitude. So don&#8217;t forget&#8211;Jannah is the ultimate goal, the ultimate reward, yes&#8211;but your rewards start here as well, inshaAllah.

And one last difference: when disasters strike, non-Muslims and people with low eman go **crazy**. Muslims bear through it with patience. That&#8217;s why nobody can have the quality of life we can have.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) give us the best of this life and the next life.
