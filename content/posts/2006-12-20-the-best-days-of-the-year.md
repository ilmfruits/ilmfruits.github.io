Are you a student, or working? Are you depressed or frustrated that you could not take the advantage of the last ten nights of Ramadan? There were midterms, assignments, and projects for all the working folk, all those cliched reasons, or maybe you did take advantage. Here is another chance. Its on our doorsteps, the most beloved days to Allah, the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah.

It was reported by Ibn ‘Abbas (رضي الله عنه) that the Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah **than these ten days**.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;**Not even** jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight, giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&#8221; (al-Bukhari)

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) in surah al-Fajr says (interpretation of the meaning): &#8220;By the dawn; by the ten nights&#8221; [89:1-2]. Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn al-Zubayr, Mujaahid and others of the earlier and later generations said that this refers to the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah. Ibn Katheer said: &#8220;This is the correct opinion.&#8221; (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 8/413)

In the ayah Allah swears an oath by the dawn and the ten nights, and Allah swearing an oath signifies the importance of these days.

What can we do to reap the fruits of these days?

<div class="miniTitle">
  Fast
</div>

In a hadith qudsi: &#8220;Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says: ‘All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I am the One Who will reward him for it.’&#8221; (al-Bukhari)

Fasting on the best days, means &#8211; jackpot &#8211; INSHALLAH more rewards.

And our Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) _for sure_ used to fast on the 9th of Dhul Hijjah. As Hunaydah ibn Khalid reported from his wife that some of the wives of the Prophet (رضي الله عنهنّ) said: &#8220;The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) used to fast on the ninth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, on the day of ‘Ashoora’, on three days of each month, and on the first two Mondays and Thursdays of each month.&#8221; (al-Nisaa’i, Abu Dawud)

<div class="miniTitle">
  Say <em>Takbeer, </em><em>Tahmeed</em> and <em>Tahleel</em>
</div>

It is reported that our Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) commanded us to recite a lot of Tasbeeh (&#8220;Subhanallah&#8221;), Tahmeed (&#8220;Al-hamdu Lillaah&#8221;) and Takbeer (&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221;) during this time. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) reported that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahleel (&#8220;La ilaha ill-Allah&#8221;), Takbeer and Tahmeed.&#8221; (Ahmad, Ahmad Shaakir stated that it is saheeh).

There are so many other good deeds to do, so we should take advantage of these days as much as we can.
