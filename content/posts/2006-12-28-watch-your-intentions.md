  There are many times throughout our daily activities that we do things without clarifying the intention to ourselves. We may buy a new car but end up doing it to raise our status in society or for pride. At the same time though, we may buy a car and do it solely for Allah&#8217;s cause, and in this there is good.
</p>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<p align="center">
  <strong>&#8220;So whomsoever does good equal to the wieght of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it.&#8221;<br /> </strong>&#8211; Surah Az-Zalzalah V.7
</p>

<p align="left">
  In an explanation of this ayat it is narrated by Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) and collected in Sahih Bukhari that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said:
</p>

&#8220;Horses are kept for one of three purposes: A man may keep them (for Allah&#8217;s cause to receive a reward in the Hereafter); another may keep them (as a means of his livelihood) protection (from begging others) and a third may keep them (out of pride and to show off) to be a burden for him&#8230;&#8221;

<p align="left">
  The hadith in and of itself is quite long, but Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) continues to narrate:
</p>

<p align="left">
  &#8220;As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps it for Allah&#8217;s Causes, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture&#8230;whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture&#8230;will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope&#8230;for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be written for him. And if it passes by a rive and drinks of its water, though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So, the horse will be reward for such a man&#8221;
</p>

<p align="left">
  Subhanallah! This goes to show the true Mercy of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and it shows how Gracious and Giving our Lord really is. Can you imagine the reward piling up for such a person who commits to having something and using it for the sake of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)? Surely, on the Day of Judgment such a man will be astonished to see the amount of his good deeds.
</p>

<p align="left">
  Continuing the hadith, Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) narrates:
</p>

<p align="center">
  &#8220;&#8230;But if a man ties (the horse) out of pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be burden (of sins) for him.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was asked regarding donkeys. He replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive verse which includes everything:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>&#8220;So whomsoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whomsoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall it&#8221;<br /> </strong>&#8211; Surah Az-Zalzalah V.7-8
</p>

Can you imagine? Subhanallah, may Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) make us amongst those whose good deeds out-wiegh the evil deeds. May He make us amongst those who are able to make our wealth, our lives, our death, our everything for His sake and His sake only.

Be of those who desire to do everything for Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) because He will not disappoint you on The Day it will matter the most
