<p class="gem">
  All people on Earth seek happiness&#8211;whether it&#8217;s through wealth, or love, or piety. Few realize that perfect happiness does not exist in the dunya.
</p>

When you think about it, you&#8217;ll find that hardship and pain exist with moments of great happiness. For example, you ate your favourite meal after a long time, but you feel over-full and you become tired and lazy. Or, you enjoy a wonderful hike through the woods, minus the insect bites and that bee that flew into your ear.

So be aware, and aim for higher then dunya happiness.

_This is a mercy of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)_. If you found the perfect happiness, and subhanallah, someone talked to you about paradise, you might say &#8220;who cares? I&#8217;ve found the perfect happiness _here_.&#8221;

<p class="gem">
  True happiness exists only in Jannah.
</p>

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) unite us all in Jannah and grant us all al-Firdaus, out of His mercy.
