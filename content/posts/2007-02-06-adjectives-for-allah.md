excerpt: Ar-Rahmaan, Ar-Raheem, and Maliki Yawmid-Deen are all adjectives for Allah--hence why they have kasra on them.

Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  الْحَمْدُ للّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ الرَّحْمـنِ الرَّحِيمِ<br /> مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
</div>

You might ask, why do rabb, <dfn title="الرَّحْمـن">Ar-Rahmaan</dfn>, <dfn title="الرَّحِيم">Ar-Raheem</dfn>, and <dfn title="مَالِكِ">Maalik</dfn> all have kasra on them? Why not dumma [(the default)][1], or fatha?

The answer is that, wallahu &#8216;alim, they are na&#8217;at (adjactives) for Allah&#8211;words that describe His greatness.

For example, Ar-Rahmaan means &#8220;the source of mercy&#8221; (that&#8217;s why, scholars say, you cannot name your son Rahman). Ar-Raheem is the one who shows mercy to the creation.

And <dfn title="رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ">rabbil &#8216;alamiyn</dfn> means &#8220;Lord of the Worlds&#8221; (yes, worlds, not world). And Maaliki Yawmid-Deen means king or soverign of the Day of Recompense.

Inshallah we&#8217;ll post more details (tafseer) on each of these aspects in the future.
