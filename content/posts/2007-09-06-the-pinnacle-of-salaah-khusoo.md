Khushoo is to be conscious of God, to have taqwa, to have fear of Allah. And so khushoo is something that comes from the heart, and if the heart is clean, then the salaah&#8211;and everything else&#8211;will be clean. There are many ways that one can go about gaining khusoo; a few of them a few are:

  1. prepare ahead of time by performing wudoo properly
  2. use miswak
  3. repeat the words of the adhaan
  4. make du&#8217;a between the adhaan and the iqaamah
