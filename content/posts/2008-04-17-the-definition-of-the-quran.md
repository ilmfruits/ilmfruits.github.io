So what exactly _is_ the Qur&#8217;an?

Scholars define the Qur&#8217;an as this: The **Arabic speech of Allah** that was **revealed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)** both **in word and in meaning**. It is **collected between the two covers of the mushaaf**, was **narrated in mutawaatir chains**, and is a **challenge to humankind**.

We can learn five important things about the Qur&#8217;an from this definition.

  1. **The Arabic speech of Allah:** The Qur&#8217;an is the speech of Allah, in Arabic. This means that anything that&#8217;s not Arabic isn&#8217;t the Qur&#8217;an. You can&#8217;t pray in English, in French, in Swahili, in Urdu&#8211;it has to be in Arabic.
  2. **Revealed to the Prophet:** We know that Allah revealed many revelations&#8211;including the Injeel and the Tawrah and the Zabur. Those are also revelation of Allah&#8211;but they&#8217;re not the Qur&#8217;an. Only what Allah revealed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is Qur&#8217;an.
  3. **Revealed in Word and Meaning:** Not Only is the _meaning_ of the Qur&#8217;an the same as what Allah meant; but the _words themselves_ are also from Allah. (Unlike Hadith Qudsi, where the meaning is from Allah, and the words are from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم))
  4. **Collected between Two Covers:** Hadith Qudsi is also the speech of Allah, but it&#8217;s not Qur&#8217;an. Similarly, there are verses that used to be in the Qur&#8217;an, but aren&#8217;t anymore&#8211;even though they were once! These are the abrogated verses, and they&#8217;re not considered Qur&#8217;an anymore, even though we still know what some of those revelations were.
  5. **Mutawaatir:** The Qur&#8217;an was related in a mutawaatir fashion&#8211;so many narrators narrated it, at every single step in the chain of narration, that it&#8217;s impossible that they all lied or made a mistake.
  6. **A Challenge to Humankind:** The Qur&#8217;an is an ongoing challenge to the human race&#8211;create a book, a surah, a verse like it; but nay, we will NEVER be able to. Allah Himself says so.

One other important part of the definition of the Qur&#8217;an is that **Allah promised that He will protect it, until the end of time**&#8211;and that promise doesn&#8217;t apply to anything else (such as the sunnah, or the Hadith Qudsi).

And you thought you knew the Qur&#8217;an!

May Allah allow us all to become saahibul-Qur&#8217;an, Companions of the Qur&#8217;an, those whom Allah will give the highest level of jannah (ameen)!
