There are six stages of knowledge.

  1. **Knowledge of Facts:** know the information (eg. what year did &#8216;Umar (radiallahu &#8216;an) become the Khalifa?)
  2. **Comprehension:** think about the information and understand it (eg. the khalifa is in charge of the entire Muslim ummah)
  3. **Application:** learn and apply the knowledge&#8211;it helps you remember. Apply it to your context. What does it mean for you and me, here, today?
  4. **Analysis:** Analyze the information critically. Get a deeper understanding of the meaning.
  5. **Synthesis:** Link the information to other information you know.
  6. **Evaluation:** recognize more authentic information over other information.

If you study at a university in Canada, you may notice that most of what they teach you doesn&#8217;t go beyond the Comprehension stage. Some may reach the Application stage, depending on your field&#8211;or it may not.

  Learn to think critically!

May Allah protect us from knowledge that does not benefit us, ameen.
