Now that you know what [barakah][1] is, you might ask, how can one increase the barakah in his or her life? Aside from visiting the [places with barakah][2], and making use of [times with barakah][3], what else can you do?

The answer is very simple. <span class="gem">If you want Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to bless you, then do anything for the sake of Allah, upon the sunnah (methodology) of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم).</span>

Thus every act can become a candidate for more barakah. Even things like going to work and shopping for food&#8211;properly done, with the right intention, can become something blessed. You&#8217;ll be more productive at work. The food you buy feeds you for a longer time. And so on.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) increase us all in our barakah.
