Continuing our study of the fruits of <dfn title="faith">eman</dfn>, here are some additional fruits that spring from the tree of eman:

<div class="miniTitle">
  18) Benefit From Advice
</div>

In Surah Adh-Dhariyat, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  وَذَكِّرْ فَإِنَّ الذِّكْرَى تَنفَعُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** And continue to remind, for surely the reminder profits the believers. (Surah Adh-Dhariyat, verse 55)<sup>1</sup>

Notice, here, who benefits from the reminders&#8211;not all humankind, but **believers**. Why? Try this hypothethical situation on for size: there&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s sinning&#8211;say he&#8217;s drinking beer in front of you inside his home. You give him advice to stop drinking&#8211;and remind him of the rewards, punishments, etc. of good deeds and bad deeds. What happens? He&#8217;ll cry and acknowledge your advice and inshaAllah move to practical steps.

But, try the same thing on someone _without_ eman, and what happens? He&#8217;ll ignore your advice, for sure&#8211;maybe even insult you. Or maybe he&#8217;ll take it a step further and mock Islam. (Try telling someone in a bar not to drink.)

What does this show? Simple equation: **eman + sins = overcome sins**.

And _that_ is why you remind the believers&#8211;because it benefits them, and them alone.

May Allah write us all down as believers, ameen!
