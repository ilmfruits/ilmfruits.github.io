One of the ways in which Islamic finance differs greatly from conventional law is in the debt-for-debt transaction. **In Islamic finance, a debt-for-debt transaction is not allowed.**

And this is one of the big factors in the current economic depression&#8211;people selling a debt for a debt for a debt for &#8230; one report says that America is built on debt **seven times** over! The guy at the bottom finally asks for his commodity, and all the people in the chain realize there was nothing there at all; it&#8217;s all debt on debt.

So let&#8217;s examine what a debt-for-debt transaction means.

**Transaction means, an exchange of money/commodities takes place between a buyer and seller.** The important point here is: no exchange means no transaction took place.

**Debt for debt means you cannot sell something tomorrow for some money tomorrow.** For example, you go to a guy selling mangoes. You say &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy 3 mangoes tomorrow for $20, which I&#8217;ll pay you tomorrow.&#8221; THAT&#8217;S debt-for-debt.

Or, in Medinah university, students leaving their last year liquidate their belongings. So a student A (who&#8217;s graduating) might want to sell his car to student B. Their conversation might go:

`<br />
Student A: So you like the car? It's $10,000.<br />
Student B: Yeah, it looks good. I'll take it.<br />
Student A: Ok. I'm leaving in 7 days, so one of my conditions is that I can use the car until I leave.<br />
Student B: Sure, no problem.<br />
(They shake hands)<br />
` 

WHOA! What just happened there?

  * Student A owes a car to student B
  * Student B owes $10,000 to student A

That&#8217;s debt-for-debt! That transaction is not permissible!

As you can tell, debt-for-debt appears A LOT in our every-day interaction. How can we make these transactions permissible? Recall the first three fundamental principles of Islamic finance:

  1. **All transactions are halal until proven otherwise.** In this case, we know it&#8217;s otherwise already. 
      * **Do our best to make the transaction permissible before declaring it impermissible.** Change the transaction to make it permissible (not through loopholes, but using legitimate means).
      * **When all else fails, the transaction is considered impermissible.** Contrary to what most Muslims believe, haram is NOT the default ruling on financial transactions.</ol> 
    Given this understanding, there are a few things you can do to make this type of transaction permissible:
    
      1. **Consider it a _promise_, not a contract.** A promise means, a morally/spiritually/ethically/islamically sound promise to buy; it is NOT a contract&#8211;so you cannot take the person to the qadi (judge) or the courts. Islamically, you should fulfill your promise; but it&#8217;s not the same as a legal contract. You promise to buy the mangoes tomorrow, and you come back tomorrow and do so. (One difference from a contract is: he might have already sold his mangoes tomorrow. Or you might have something come up and be unavailable; legally, nothing has taken place.)
      2. **Take a down payment.** As the seller, ask for a non-refundable down payment; or as the buyer, offer it. Once done, commodities/exchange has taken place&#8211;a transaction has taken place. Thus, it&#8217;s not debt-for-debt anymore. So offer up a $5 deposit on that box of mangoes!
      3. **Buy from someone else.** Especially living in non-Muslim lands, if you&#8217;re the buyer and you can&#8217;t get what you want from one seller, buy it from someone else. Don&#8217;t fall into debt-for-debt.
    
    Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
