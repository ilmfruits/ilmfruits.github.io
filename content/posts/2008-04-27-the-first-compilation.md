excerpt: |
  During the time of Abu Bakr, 70 huffadh were martyred.  After this, 'Umar ibn Al-Khattab discussed with Abu Bakr, and they decided to compile the Qur'an into book format--prior to this, it was never compiled.  Why wasn't it compiled in the time of the Prophet?  Many reasons.  They both chose Zayd, for several reasons--including his piety and knowledge of the Qur'an.  He said, "If they had asked me to lift a mountain, it would've been easier for me than this task."

The Qur&#8217;an was first compiled during the lifetime of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (رضي الله عنه‏), the first khalifa, whose rule lasted from the death of the last messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for two years.

Why wasn&#8217;t it compiled during the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself?

  * **On-Going Revelation:** Revelation was still coming down. If you wrote two verses next to each other, and Allah revealed one in the middle&#8211;or an extension to the end of a surah&#8211;what then? They didn&#8217;t have staplers to staple pages into the middle!
  * **No Need:** The Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was still alive, and so were his companions, and they were all there with him. What need was there to compile it? The knowledge was there in the community.
  * **Arrangement was not Finalized:** New verses would come down and be added to the middle of surahs. If it&#8217;s already written in a book, what do you do? How can you fit it in?
  * **Abrogation:** Although abrogated verses are very few, sometimes a verse would be abrogated&#8211;so what if it was written down? What do you do with it?

In any case, in Abu Bakr&#8217;s time, there was a big battle, where 70 huffadh were martyred. After this one battle, &#8216;Umar convinced Abu Bakr&#8211;who was hesitant at first&#8211;to compile the Qur&#8217;an into one book. Prior to this, it was written down in scraps and fragments; and some of it was only memorized, not written down. And &#8216;Umar feared that the unwritten parts would be lost.

So together, they agreed; and they agreed on who would compile the Qur&#8217;an&#8211;Zayd ibn Thabit (رضي الله عنه‏).

Why Zayd? He was the main scribe of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), he was a hafidh himself, and he was known was his piety and knowledge of the Qur&#8217;an.

What did Zayd say? He was hesitant too, at first&#8211;but then he agreed. They all knew the necessity of it. Zayd said, then: &#8220;If they had asked me to move a mountain, I would&#8217;ve found that easier then the task they gave me.&#8221; [Saheeh Bukhari]

Because of the responsibility&#8211;the _entire Ummah, for all time,_ is relying on Zayd.

And he compiled it. Despite being a hafidh, he gathered the sahaba. His condition? He would collect verses that **two sahaba heard DIRECTLY from the lips of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)**&#8211;nothing less.

And he was a hafidh! He knew the WHOLE Qur&#8217;an! Still, he made this his criterion.

And so, bit by bit, over eight months, he collected it.

And there it was&#8211;the first mushaf, the first fully compiled end-to-end Qur&#8217;an.
