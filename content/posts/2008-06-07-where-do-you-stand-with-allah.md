excerpt: 'We all have titles and labels in our lives today that are defined by our characteristics. We are known in our families and communities with these labels, be they nicknames or professional titles.  But what is our label with Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)? How are we written with Him? In a famous hadeeth of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), he explains how two character traits that we today may not see as a significant, can lead one to Paradise or Hell-Fire. Which of these two traits do we possess? '

<div class="arabicHadith">
  حدثنا زهير بن حرب وعثمان بن أبي شيبة وإسحاق بن إبراهيم قال إسحاق أخبرنا وقال الآخران حدثنا جرير عن منصور عن أبي وائل عن عبد الله قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إن الصدق يهدى إلى البر وإن البر يهدى إلى الجنة وإن الرجل ليصدق حتى يكتب صديقا وإن الكذب يهدى إلى الفجور وإن الفجور يهدى إلى النار وإن الرجل ليكذب حتى يكتب كذابا
</div>

**Translation:** Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: The Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: Truthfulness (sidq) leads to righteousness (birr), and righteousness leads to Paradise. And a man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes and is written as a truthful person (siddeeq). And Falsehood/lying (kithb) leads to Al-Fajoor (wickedness, evil-doing), and Al-Fajoor (wickedness) leads to the Fire, and a man may keep on telling lies till he is written before Allah, a liar (kathaab). [Saheeh Bukhari, Book of Manners, #116]

Birr is from ba-ra-ra and it literally means a vast and open piece a land, with so many types of herbage and fruits. Birr means vastness of good deeds. Someone who is baarun (one who does birr) does all types of good deeds, and these people, al-abraar (plural of baarun), are those who are truly righteous. Next time you read the Qur&#8217;an, look for this word &#8220;al-abraar&#8221; (الابرار)and see which context these people are mentioned.

The hadeeth says that whoever is truthful, they will be lead to do these vast good deeds and then eventually they will be written as a &#8220;siddeeq&#8221;. Notice this word, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not say a &#8216;saadiq&#8217;, but he said &#8216;siddeeq&#8217;. A &#8216;siddeeq&#8217; is way better than a saadiq. They not only tell the truth, they always speak the truth, and they stand by it and live by it until it becomes their nature. All they do is tell the truth, again and again. Think of [Abu Bakr][1] _as-siddeeq_ (رضي الله عنه‏) and how he earned this name.

On the other hand, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said that the man who lies will be lead to &#8220;fujoor&#8221; and then is written as a kathaab. Al-Fujoor is from fa-jeem-ra and it means to break open, cross, and deviate (significance of words beginning with fa). Fujoor is also intensified and it shows that causing corruption and wickedness is embedded in this person&#8217;s nature. Their actions are based on it and it is part of their character. Also, the word for liar used is a &#8220;kathaab&#8221;, which is not just a kaathib (a liar), but a huge liar. One who is always lying until it&#8217;s just second nature for lies to come out of his mouth. All they do is lie, again and again. Think of Musaylimah _al-kathaab_ and how he earned this name.

So the question is, where do we stand with Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)? How are you written with Him? As a siddeeq or a kathaab? This reminder is for myself first and foremost.

Allahumma ijalnaa min as-siddeeqeen, wa la tajalnaa min al-khaathibeen. O Allah, make us among those who are always truthful, and do not make us among those who are liars. Ameen!
