A man came to the Prophet (salallhu alayhi wa sallam) from Al-Yamamah, learned some Quran, and apostated and joined Musalimah. His kunya (pet-name) was Ar-Rajal (&#8220;the man&#8221;). He endorsed Musaylimah.

His fitna was _more intense_ then Musaylimah. People thought he was learned and scholarly, and _he_ believed in Musaylimah. It caused a _huge_ doubt among the ignorant people. They felt that if Ar-Rajal listened, they should listen, too.

Today, everyone has endorsements. <span class="gem">You need to learn to see beyond the endorsements.</span> If the whole world says it&#8217;s haram, and this _one_ shaykh says it&#8217;s ok, he endorses it, it causes mass confusion.
