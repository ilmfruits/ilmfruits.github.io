When someone dies, we say &#8220;inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon.&#8221; It means, roughly translated, &#8220;We belong to Allah and to Him we return.&#8221;

Inshallah here, we&#8217;ll do a brief (grammatical) dissection of the phrase, so you can understand the words better (and not mix them up / mispronounce them). If you hover your mouse over <dfn title="surprise!">underlined</dfn> words, you&#8217;ll see the Arabic inshallah.

<dfn title="إنَّ">Inna</dfn>: Inna is really <dfn title="إنَّنَ">inna-na</dfn>. The first part is &#8220;very&#8221;, the last part is &#8220;we&#8221;&#8211;but Arabs like to simplify, so they just write it as inna (with only two noons). It means &#8220;Indeed, we&#8221; or &#8220;verily, we&#8221;.

<dfn title="لِلَّهِ">Li-llahi</dfn>: <dfn title="لِ">Li</dfn> is a [harfu jarr (preposition)][1] meaning &#8220;to&#8221; or &#8220;is for.&#8221; We use it as a kind of possessive case. &#8220;<dfn title="ألَكَ أخُن">a laka akhun</dfn>&#8221; (the la is really the same as li) means &#8220;is for you a brother?&#8221; or &#8220;do you have a brother?&#8221; So here, &#8220;lillahi&#8221; means &#8220;belong to Allah&#8221; or &#8220;are for Allah&#8221;. (It&#8217;s also because of the li that Allah takes kasra.)

<dfn title="وَ">Wa</dfn>: Wa means &#8220;and&#8221;.

<dfn title="إلَيهِ">Ilay-hi</dfn>: This is two parts, it means &#8220;to him&#8221;. <dfn title="إلَي">Ilay</dfn> is actually a form of <dfn title="إلَ">ila</dfn> (a preposition), which means &#8220;to&#8221;. We say things like, &#8220;<dfn title="ذَهَبتُ إلَ مَسجِدً">thahabtu ila masjidin</dfn>&#8221; &#8212; I went to a masjid. &#8220;<dfn title="هِ">Hi</dfn>&#8221; is actually &#8220;<dfn title="هُ">hu</dfn>&#8220;, the third-person possessive pronoun (&#8220;his&#8221;). (It takes kasra because of ila.) So the overall translation is &#8220;to him&#8221;.

<dfn title="رَجِعُون">Rajioon</dfn>: This is some form of the verb &#8220;to return&#8221;, not sure on the details&#8211;people usually translate it as &#8220;we will return.&#8221; It is plural (so refers to 3+ people).

So taken together, we get a translation of &#8220;indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to him we return.&#8221;

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
