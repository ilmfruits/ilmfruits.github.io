The dedication of sahaba is no joke. They strove beyond the physical limtations of their bodies. When they couldn&#8217;t stand, or open their eyes, they continued. Their dedication to Allah transcended their bodies.

In the battle of **Yamamah,** when Abdullah ibn &#8216;Umar (RA) lay in the nursing docks after one battle, he heard a shout from outside&#8211;<span class="foreignWords">ya ahlil ansar</span>, &#8220;o people of the Ansar&#8221;. He spotted an ansari nearby&#8211;a man critically injured, couldn&#8217;t walk, incapacitated, being nursed. The ansari grabbed his sword, and dragged himself out of bed and towards the exit.

Abdullah said (to the meaning of): &#8220;How can you fight? You can hardly stand up.&#8221;

The ansari said (to the meaning of): &#8220;I will never hear the call of the ansar and turn my back. That&#8217;s not what ansar do.&#8221; And he left and joined the battle.

When you feel tired or lazy, remember these lessons. The Sahaba did not necessarily run the fastest, but the longest. They remained consistant, even when others grow bored or tired.

On the third day of the battle of **Qadisiyyah**&#8211;a three day battle that included 33 war elephants, and between 100k and 200k Roman warriors against 36k Muslims&#8211;the Muslim general said (to the meaning of): &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve been fighting all day, and you&#8217;re tired. Remain patient. Victory comes to the patient.&#8221;

Imagine that. The heat and sweat of battle. You carry heavy armour and equipment, suffer wounds, and fight out in the desert through the heat of the day&#8211;not sit in front of a computer screen or TV, but _fight_&#8211;and then the amir said &#8220;be patient&#8221;.

When dawn came, the Muslims rejoiced in victory. Allahu akbar.

Those who run only a few meters farther or a few milliseconds faster than their opponents win.
