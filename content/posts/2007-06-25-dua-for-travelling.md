  The du'a for traveling, which the Messenger of Allah taught us, is for our own protection.  "Glory to the one who subjugated this to us ..."  It's in Surah Zukhruf, verses 13 to 14.

Whether you travel by foot or by bike, by bus or by car, by train or by plane, you should recite the du&#8217;a the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us &#8212; because <span class="gem">du&#8217;as are always for our protection</span>.

This du&#8217;a, in particular, comes in handy these days, since **so many people have to commute** to school or work.

Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  لِتَسْتَوُوا عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ <strong>وَتَقُولُوا</strong> سُبْحانَ الَّذِي سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ<br /> وَإِنَّا إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** In order that you may mount firmly on their backs, and then may remember the Favour of your Lord when you mount thereon, and **say**: &#8220;Glory to Him who has subjected this to us, and we could never have it (by our efforts). And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return!&#8221; [Surah Zukhruf, verse 13-14]
