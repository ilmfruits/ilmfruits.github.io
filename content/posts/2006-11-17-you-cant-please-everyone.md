Today I have learned a valuable lesson, and I believe its a lesson that all of you readers can benefit from. The lesson itself is very simple, but realizing the importance and understanding the implications it may have in one’s life is what matters the most. The lesson is: <span class="gem">you can‘t please everyone. </span>Sounds so simple, right? Many of us are reading this and saying, well duh! So then, if its so obvious why do we keep persisting in our efforts to doing so? <span class="gem">It’s not possible!</span>

_Its just like when you buy a new pair of shoes. Your mother hates them, so you return them and buy a new pair. You bring them home and this time your brother doesn’t like the colour, so you return them again. You bring home a new pair and this time your sister thinks they&#8217;re just hideous! Fed up, you return them again. And the vicious circle keeps going and going and going…conclusion: **you can’t please everyone!**_

So now, since you can’t please everyone, DON’T BOTHER! Rather choose to please _Al-Khaliq, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Raheem, Maliki Yawmid-Deen — please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)_ and then watch.

<p class="gem">
  When you choose to disregard Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to please the people of this duniya, those very people will begin to be displeased with you and wil begin to disregard you. However, if you disregard the people of this duniya to please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), those very people will eventually begin to regard you and will begin to be pleased with you.
</p>

So now the question we must ask ourselves is…**who are we going to please? The People or Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)?** 

Are we going to please our boss and shave our beards for that great promotion? Or are we going to persevere and please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)?

Are we going to neglect the commands of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to wear the hijab to please our friends and society? Or are we going to struggle through and please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)?

Are we going to please our parents and just marry that “ideal” doctor whos fully loaded? Or are we going to marry the one which will surely please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)?

My brothers and sisters, the choice is yours. But word of advice: nothing good will ever come if you don’t firstly please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Sure, you may earn money, you may get girls, you may have cars, and houses, and everything else that duniya offers, but that void that sits in your heart will never we content without pleasing Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).
