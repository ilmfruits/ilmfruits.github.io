With the Facebook craze that has struck us all in the past months, we have forgotten about a very serious matter that our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسل) talked about, and that matter being exposing of ones sins. We post messages on peoples walls, we post up pictures and what not, and its all exposing our sins to the public. We should be very cautious of the environment and inshallah try our best to protect our own dignity but also the dignity and respect of our brothers and sisters. This is not only apparent through the Facebook craze but also through general interactions of Muslims today.

My brothers and sisters, I love you for the sake of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and I only write this as sincere advice to myself and to you all. The following hadith will put things in to focus for us all:

The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: **&#8220;My entire nation is safe, except al-Mujahirin (those who boast of their sins). Among the Mujaharah is that a man commits an (evil) act, and wakes up in the morning while Allah has kept his (sin) a secret, he says: &#8220;O so-and-so! Last night I did this and that.&#8221; He goes to sleep while Allah has kept his (sin) a secret but he wakes up in the morning and uncovers what Allah has kept a secret!&#8221;** [Saheeh al-Bukhari]

Abdullah Ibn Masoud (رضي الله عنه) related, &#8220;A man came to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) and said: **&#8216;O Messenger of Allah! I have mingled with a woman in the far side of al-Medina, and I fulfilled my desire short of actually having sexual intercourse with her. So, here am I, judge me according to what you decide.&#8217; Umar Ibn al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) then said: &#8216;Allah had kept your secret, why did not you keep your secret?&#8221;** [Sharh Muslim]

May Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) give us the ability to understand and obey.
