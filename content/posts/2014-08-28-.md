Omar Ibn Khattab said: &#8220;Learn Arabic, for it is of your Deen&#8221;

Al Imam Ashshafie said: &#8220;..that is because the tongue (language) which Allah has chosen is the Arabic one, so He has revealed His book by it and made it the tongue of his last prophet Mohammed &#8211; صلى الله عليه و سلم &#8211; that is why we say: Anyone who is able to learn Arabic should do so because it is the language that aught to be learned &#8221;
  
Imam Malik said: &#8221; If I was to reach an aim in sciences, and an end in understanding I wouldn&#8217;t be out of two sources: The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet, and there is no way to them except by knowing the Arabic tongue&#8221;

Many of us want to learn Arabic, but we don&#8217;t know where to start. There are many programs, curriculum and books available nowadays, each with a different style and focus. In this post, I will provide review and information on some of the popular online programs. InshAllah, I hope to update this post regularly as new programs become available.

**1. Madinah Arabic Books:**

These books are taught in the first two years of Madinah University Islamic Degree program. It is best to be done under a teacher. However, if you are doing it on your own, you can benefit from these <a href="http://www.lqtoronto.com/videos.html" target="_blank">video recordings</a> and <a href="http://www.lqtoronto.com/madinasolutions.html" target="_blank">solution to exercises</a>. After finishing this course, you would be able to read, speak and understand Arabic. However, the course is long and slowly progresses from one topic to another. So this requires patience on the student side. So if your immediate/short term goal is just to be able to learn Quran, then there are other alternate courses that focus just on that.

2. Arabic With Husna With Nouman Ali Khan: [polldaddy rating=&#8221;7783158&#8243;]

This is offered as part of monthly subscription to <a href="http://www.bayyinah.tv/" target="_blank">bayyinah tv</a>. With this subscription, you get access to many of Nouman Ali Khan lectures, including the series &#8220;Arabic with Husna&#8221;. They also offer nine month full time intensive <a href="http://bayyinah.com/dream/" target="_blank">Bayyinah Dream</a> program offered in US, where students stay at the campus and learn directly from the teachers.

3. <a href="http://www.shariahprogram.ca/" target="_blank">Shariah Program</a>:

This is a very famous program. Ustadh Yusuf Milam has a very different approach than other programs. He starts with teaching the core, complex, widely used and applicable topics in the beginning and reinforces these concepts through the study of &#8220;Stories of Prophets&#8221; children book in Arabic. In the second semester, classical grammar book &#8220;Hidaya nau&#8221; is taught and in second year, various arabic tafaseers are studied. They have recorded lessons as well as live sessions for practice and Q/A. Although the program is little pricey but it has many good testimonials &#8211; even from students who took other Arabic courses and then settled on Shariah Program.

4. <a href="http://understandquran.com/" target="_blank">Understand Quran</a>:

This is a great program especially for those whose primary goal is to be able to understand Quran. The vocabulary and grammar is taught via duas and surahs that all of us know &#8211; last 10 surahs of 30th juzz, various adhkars of salah, small duas etc. They have basic, intermediate and advance course and offer a free seven trail as well.  The focus is on learning key grammar concepts and vocabulary to help us understand Quran.

5. <a href="http://www.islamiconlineuniversity.com/iap/" target="_blank">Arabic intensive Program by Islamic Online University</a>:

This is a new two year program offered by <a href="http://www.islamiconlineuniversity.com/" target="_blank">Islamic Online University</a> (founded by Dr Bilal Philips). This will be offered for the first time this year (2014). Curriculum has mix of new and classical books (Madinah books and Al-Ajroomiyah etc). The <a href="http://www.islamiconlineuniversity.com/iap/scale-fee.php" target="_blank">semester fees </a> is very affordable as well.

IOU also offers <a href="http://www.islamiconlineuniversity.com/opencampus/course/index.php?categoryid=21" target="_blank">Tadabur Quran course</a>, which is offered live on the internet with recordings available. Its similar to UnderstandQuran in its approach and focusses on Quranic Arabic, lessons, reflections and tafseer.

If you have done any of these programs, please provide your feedback in the comments or if you have suggestion for a program not listed here, please mention in the comments as well.
