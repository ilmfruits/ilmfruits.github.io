Bismillah

We know that Allah ta&#8217;ala Name&#8217;s Ar-Raheem is specifically for the believers, so how is it that one can receive this special Mercy from ar Raheem?

<ul type="square">
  <li>
    <strong>Obedience to Allah and His Messenger</strong>. <em>&#8220;</em>and obey Allah and His Messenger so that you all may receive Mercy.&#8221; [3:132]
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Taqwa of Allah ta&#8217;ala</strong>, fear and consciousness of Allah. &#8220;And this is a book, We have sent it down as one blessed, so follow it and fear Allah so that you all may receive Mercy.<em>&#8221; </em>[6:155]  Similarly Allah says: <em>&#8220;</em>and My Mercy encompasses all things, so soon I will write it for those who have taqwa.&#8221; [7:156]
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Doing ihsaan (utmost good) towards Allah and the creation</strong>. &#8220;Indeed the Mercy of Allah is near to those who do utmost good.&#8221; [7:156]
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Praying four rak&#8217;aat before &#8216;Asr prayer. </strong>The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam said: “May Allah have mercy on one who prays 4 raka’aat before the ‘Asr Prayer.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi no. 395 and he declared it a hassan, Al-Albany rated the Hadith as hassan in Sahih al-Jami’ No. 3493.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Listening to the Qur&#8217;an attentively and remaining silent.</strong> “And when the Quran is recited, listen to it with attention, that you may receive Mercy.” [7:204]
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ha</strong><strong>ving rahmah towards the creation of Allah</strong>. A hadith in Musnad Ahmad states, <em>&#8220;</em>Show mercy so that you may be shown mercy, forgive and Allah will forgive you.&#8221; There is another hadith narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood that states, &#8220;The merciful will be give mercy by the Most Merciful. Have mercy to those on earth and the one in the heavens will have mercy upon you.&#8221;  Also Allah ta&#8217;ala says in the Qur&#8217;an, Do you not love that Allah should forgive you?  [24:22] So if you want mercy, you want knowledge of the Qur&#8217;an, you want Jannah, you want Guidance? Show mercy to others.
  </li>
</ul>

May Allah ta&#8217;ala shower His mercy upon us, Ameen.
