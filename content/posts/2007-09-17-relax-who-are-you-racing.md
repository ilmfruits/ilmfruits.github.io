We at times find ourself in a race with salaah. One of the primary ways to gain khushoo in our salaah is to take our time in it, so much so that our Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) told us to be slow and articulate with each movement&#8211;we should let all our bones rest and then continue on, not before that. No need to race, because this will come back on the Day of Judgment! Truly, the poorest on that Day will be the one who stole from his salaah by racing through it!
