You&#8217;re already familiar with possessive case in English&#8211;when we show ownership of something. For example, we might say, &#8220;this is Amer&#8217;s book&#8221; or &#8220;this is the book of Amer.&#8221;

The possessive case has **two** elements:

  1. **The possessor,** i.e. the one who owns the thing. In this case, Amer.
  2. **The possessed,** i.e. the thing being owned. In this example, the book.

The possessive case in Arabic is the same. The possessed is called the <dfn title="مُضاَف">mudaf</dfn>, the possessor the <dfn title="مُضاَف إلَيه">mudaf ilayh</dfn>. It&#8217;s easiest to think of them as the form of &#8220;the x of y&#8221; rather then &#8220;y&#8217;s x&#8221;.

In English, you write an apostrophe-s after the possessor&#8211;so &#8220;Amer&#8221; becomes &#8220;Amer&#8217;s&#8221;.

In Arabic, there are two rules&#8211;one for the mudaf, and one for the mudaf ilayh.

  1. The **possessor** takes **kasra** (becomes majruw)
  2. The **possessed** becomes **[definite][1]** (by virture of being possessed).

As a first attempt before we knew these rules, we might write &#8220;the book of Amer&#8221; as &#8220;al-kitaabu Amerun&#8221;. Applying our rules:

  1. Amerun becomes Amerin
  2. Al-kitaabu becomes kitaabu

So the final sentence is &#8220;kitaabu Amerin&#8221;.

What about Ahmed&#8217;s chair? kursiyu Ahmedin. Heaven&#8217;s gate? Baabu jannatin!

If you feel you understand this bit of grammar, post an example (Arabic/transliteration and English translation) in the comments. If you have any questions, comments, clarifications, etc. post those in comments too inshallah!
