excerpt: 'The importance of salaah can be seen in the seerah of our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). Allah raised our beloved Prophet to His heights to give him the command of salaah directly, rather than sending it through Angel Jibreel. Also, the importance of salaah is seen in the seerah, when the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was on his death bed, when he had the chance to give one last message that he could give his ummah until the Day of Judgment.  He cried out, As-Salaah! As-Salaah! '

The importance of salaah can be seen in the seerah of our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). Allah raised our beloved Prophet to His heights to give him the command of salaah directly, rather than sending it through Angel Jibreel. Also, the importance of salaah is seen in the seerah, when the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) was on his death bed, when he had the chance to give one last message that he could give his ummah until the Day of Judgment. He cried out, As-Salaah! As-Salaah!
