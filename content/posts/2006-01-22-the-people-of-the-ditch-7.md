Some companions asked the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) &#8220;Who are the people most tested?&#8221; The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said &#8220;The rightly guided people.&#8221;

<p class="gem">
  Allah tests people according to the strength of their faith. As you increase in iman, your tests become tougher and tougher.
</p>

Allah tests everyone, even non-believers. So if you&#8217;re going to be tested, be tested for fleeing to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and the truth.

The scholar said: &#8220;when you are tested [o my boy], do not reveal me.&#8221; He did not wish to be tested.

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) once said: &#8220;O people! Do not wish to meet the enemy, and ask Allah for safety, but when you face the enemy, be patient, and remember that Paradise is under the shades of swords.&#8221;<sup>1</sup>

Jihad (fighting) in the path of Allah is the highest peak&#8211;the most reward for personal actions after the five pillars. Khalid bin Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, once said &#8220;Not a day made me more happy, not my marriage to a virgin nor my news of a son, but that cold, bitter day on the battlefield.&#8221;

So why did the Prophet, peace be upon him, say that? Because nobody knows the state in which they will be when the trials hit&#8211;will you be steadfast, or will you run? Will you succeed, or will you fail? Will you rise, or will you fall? In battle, specifically&#8211;on the battlefield, people dying to the right and left, blood and heat and severed body parts, fear&#8211;that&#8217;s the test. If you turn your back, it&#8217;s one of the **greatest sins**. So the Prophet says: don&#8217;t wish to be tested, because you may fail.

And seek Allah&#8217;s protection. When He tests you, that&#8217;s when you _need_ it.

When fitna (trials) of little benefit knock on your door, leave them. **You don&#8217;t want to be tested.** And safeguarding yourself is more important then this project or that organization.

May Allah protect us from the trials of the dunya, the trial of the Dajjal and the trials of the grave.
