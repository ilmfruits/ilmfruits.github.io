From the teachings of the khulafa rashideen: <span class="gem">when you&#8217;re about to do something, ask yourself: &#8220;Would I be happy and unregretful of how I spent my time today?&#8221;</span>

If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, then find something better to do with your time.

And remember: Time is one of the ONLY irreversable resources. Money comes and goes, status builds, but time, once it&#8217;s gone, it never comes back.

The Prophet, peace and blessings upon him, said: Two things about which people are deceived are their health and their time.

May Allah allow us to optimize our times in the best of manners for the best of uses. Ameen.
