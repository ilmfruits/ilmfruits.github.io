&#8216;Ibadah. We hear the word all the time. But what does it mean?

Linguistically, &#8216;ibadah means to show subserviance, or to be subserviant to.

From a shar&#8217;ee perspective, &#8216;ibadah has two meanings:

  1. The **spiritual conscience** of the worshipper&#8211;what constitutes worship spiritually.
  2. The **actions**&#8211;what consitutes worship in action.

And Ibn Tamiyyah says: &#8220;&#8216;Ibadah includes all hidden and shown actions, statements, and beliefs beloved to Allah.&#8221;

Of actions, there are two types: **natural** and **religious**.

**Natural actions** are all kinds&#8211;normal stuff, things like eating, sleeping, and blinking.

**Religious actions** are performed with a religious intention, and have a specific context and culture. For example, praying salaah is a religious action of the Muslims. And religious actions have **two parts: sincerity** (to Allah), and **conformity** (to the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him).

<p class="gem">
  Any natural act can become religious. All it requires is a change of intention.
</p>

There is a famous hadith of Salmaan al-Farsi and Abu Darda, may Allah be pleased with both. Salmaan said: &#8220;I expect Allah to **reward me in his sleep as He rewards me in Tahajjud.**&#8221; Why? Because his intention is to sleep in order to serve Allah better. <span class="gem">Sincerity transforms a natural act into an act of worship.</span>

The majority of mankind performs natural acts with **no intention** of pleasing Allah. But those acts _can_ plase Allah. Intention is the **key** difference.

The muhsin is one who worships Allah as if he can see Him, and he turns every natural act into a religious act.

May Allah give us all the tawfiq to gain maximal benefit for all our actions, ameen.
