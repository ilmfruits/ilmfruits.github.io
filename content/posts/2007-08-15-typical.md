excerpt: 'Typ‧i‧cal: Conforming to a particular type.  For someone to be "typical", he/she would be one who conforms to his society and behaves much like his environment.  Drugs, sex, music, injustice; yet "Islam started and will end as something strange." Who are YOU going to be--a Typical, or a Stranger?'

Typ‧i‧cal: Conforming to a particular type. For someone to be &#8220;typical&#8221;, he/she would be one who conforms to his society and behaves much like his environment.

Typical in the 21st century: clubbing, flirting, sex, drugs, alcohol, stealing, cheating, swearing, injustice, premarital relations, immodesty, and the list goes on and on.

So who&#8217;s typical? Is it the one who refrains from all the above, or the one indulges in it? Is it the one who&#8217;s perceived weird when he speaks out against someone swearing? Or is it the one who joins the people in their evil?

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Islam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to its (old position) of being strange, **so glad tidings for the strangers**.&#8221; [[Saheeh Muslim, Book 1, Chapter 66, #270]][1]

Alhamdolilah!

So whats it gonna be? Stranger? or Typical?
