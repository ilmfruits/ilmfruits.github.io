<a title="Follow the Sunnah – Week 1" href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/follow-the-sunnah-week-1" target="_blank">Last week</a>, we started a new series. The goal of the series is to learn and implement the sunnah in our lives. We started with the sunnah of our beloved Prophet (May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him) on waking up. I hope all of you have been practicing that sunnah. Here is the sunnah for this week:

**<span style="color: #0000ff;">Entering the Washroom</span>:**

  * Enter with slippers/shoes
  * <a href="http://makedua.com/display_dua.php?sectionid=6" target="_blank">Make the dua</a>
  * Enter with Left foot

**<span style="color: #0000ff;">After Entering the Washroom:</span>**

  * Remove your clothes(trouser, pants) after sitting down or when near to the floor
  * Use left hand for washing private part
  * Avoid the urine drops
  * After finishing, sit for a while and then stand up

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Tip of the Week:</strong></span>

Try to get someone else involved with you (friend, family member etc), so that you can remind, compete and check up on each other.  It&#8217;s easy for shaitan to distract us when we are working alone but harder when we work as group.

**Action Item:**

  1. Make a plan on how will you implement and work on this week&#8217;s sunnah item.
