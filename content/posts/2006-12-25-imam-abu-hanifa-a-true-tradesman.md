Once, a women came to Abu Hanifa (رحمالله) to sell a silk garment. Abu Hanifa asked &#8221; How much is it?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;one hundred.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is worth more than a hundred. How much?&#8221;

So the woman increased the price by hundred, and again, and when it reached four hundred, Abu Hanifa said, &#8220;It should be more than that.&#8221; The woman said, &#8221; you are mocking me.&#8221;

So, Abu Hanifa said, &#8220;bring a man to value it.&#8221; She brought a man, and he valued it at five hundred.

It shows the heedfulness of Imam Abu Hanifa in buying in trade: where one can easily deceive the selling party, he played a role to the advantage of the woman.

In another incident, a woman came to buy garment from Imam Abu Hanifa (رحمالله) and stated, &#8220;I am weak and I put myself in your hands. Sell me this garment for what it costs you.&#8221;

Abu Hanifa replied, &#8220;take it for four dirhams.&#8221; She retorted, &#8220;do not mock me. I am an old woman.&#8221;

Then Abu Hanifa said, &#8220;I bought two garments, and sold one of them for the cost of both, less four dirhams. This garment is then worth four dirhams.&#8221;

It shows another quality of Imam Abu Hanifa, he would sometimes forgo profit if the buyer was weak.

And thus it shows the quality of a TRUE tradesman, one in purchasing, the other in selling. And it also proves that <span class="gem">scholars are the ones who TRULY fear Allah.</span>
