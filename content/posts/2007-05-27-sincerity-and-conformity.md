<p class="gem">
  For any action to be accepted by Allah (سبحانه وتعال), it has to meet two requirements: sincerity and conformity.
</p>

**Sincerity** means that <span class="gem">the action must be done purely to earn the pleasure of Allah</span>, and not for other reasons (such as &#8220;because it&#8217;s cool&#8221; or &#8220;because my friends are doing it&#8221; or &#8220;so the community will love me&#8221;).

**Conformity** means that the action must be done <span class="gem">in conformity with Shari&#8217;ah, the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم)</span>. Anything outside of this is invalid (and most likely involves falling into haram).

What are some examples of different types of actions that fall into these categories?

**Insincerity with Non-Conformity:** This is the example of someone who is **totally on the wrong track and away from Islam**. If someone said &#8220;I know keeping my girlfriend/boyfriend is haram but I&#8217;m going to do it _to give them da&#8217;wa&#8221;_, this is an example of insincerity and non-conformity. The person isn&#8217;t **really** doing it for the sake of Allah&#8211;it&#8217;s just a weak excuse to justify and perpetuate their existing lifestyle and gratify their desires.

**Sincerity with Non-Conformity:** This is the example of a sincere person who falls into messed-up actions. For example, many masjids are started by honest, sincere people&#8211;who end up [taking interest loans, paying riba, and going to war with Allah][1]. Many deviant Muslims also fall into this category&#8211;such as those who innovate new acts of worship because they love the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم), or the Khawarij, who prayed, fasted, recited Qur&#8217;an in a way that was suprior to the sahaba, but then, they killed many sahaba.

**Insincerity with Conformity:** This is perhaps _the most dangerous combination, because it often leads to <dfn title="showing off">riyaa</dfn>&#8211;or worse, <dfn title="hypocricy">nifaaq</dfn>, which can exit a person from Islam._ Riyaa is the example of the first three people to enter Hellfire&#8211;because they did it so the people would call them great&#8211;or the Islamic worker who is involved in virtually _every_ project&#8211;but who, deep down, only does it so that the people will love them. Nifaaq is explained [here][2].

**Sincerity with Conformity:** This is the best of categories, for the one who strives sincerely for the sake of Allah alone&#8211;for no reward other then the reward of Allah (سبحانه وتعال)&#8211;and follows those actions within the bounds of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. The example of this is someone who prays alone in the deep darkness of the night, or gives anonymous charity, when nobody can see them or know of their actions except Allah (سبحانه وتعال), the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. And Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  <strong>تَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ</strong> يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ<br /> فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّا أُخْفِيَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَاء بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ
</div>

**Translation: Their sides forsake their beds,** to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do. [Surah Sajdah, 32:16-17] 

So work inshaAllah to make sure all your actions are sincere and conform, and reap the rewards in the akhira! And if you&#8217;re interested in learning how **all your actions** can qualify to being accepted by Allah (سبحانه وتعال) (with a sincere intention of pleasing Him), read up on [‘Ibadah, Natural Actions, Religious Actions][3].
