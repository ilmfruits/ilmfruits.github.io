excerpt: |
  Chain of Command is an AlMaghrib course taught by Abdul-Bary Yahya. This course is divided into two parts: first, the Muhadithoon, the Scholars of Hadith; and second, what is known as "Mustalah al-Hadith," the terminology and categorization of hadith. Hadith sciences can undoubtedly be the most important science in Islam for one reason: all other sciences are based on it. Do you think our worship would be the same if we did not have the classifications of ahadith, from da'eef (weak) to saheeh (authentic)? How about fiqh? Aqeedah? Without the hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his sunnah we would be completely lost.

The sciences of hadith, and its importance. What is &#8220;sunnah,&#8221; its importance, its authority in Islam, who were the scholars of hadith, their books, and what is the terminology of hadith.

Chain of Command is an AlMaghrib course taught by Abdul-Bary Yahya. This course is divided into two parts: first, the Muhadithoon, the Scholars of Hadith; and second, what is known as &#8220;Mustalah al-Hadith,&#8221; the terminology and categorization of hadith. Hadith sciences can undoubtedly be the most important science in Islam for one reason: all other sciences are based on it. Do you think our worship would be the same if we did not have the classifications of ahadith, from da&#8217;eef (weak) to saheeh (authentic)? How about fiqh? Aqeedah? Without the hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his sunnah we would be completely lost.

Rasululllah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah dominant upon the truth. The ones who abandon them will not be able to harm them, until the decree of Allah comes.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim] What do the scholars say about this group and hadith? Most importantly, there will always be a group among this ummah guided. Also, Imam Ahmad said, &#8220;if they are not the people of Hadith, then I don&#8217;t know who they are.&#8221; Abdullah ibn Mubarak said, &#8220;It is the scholars of Hadith.&#8221; This does not mean that other scholars are misguided, but if an individual does not believe in or rejects the ahadith, they will eventually go astray.

Some benefits of studying hadith:

  * You are able to follow in the footsteps, words and actions of the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم)
  * You will have the ability to extract rulings from the sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)
  * You will learn lots of Arabic by memorizing ahadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)
  * Realize the miracle of &#8220;Jawaami&#8217; al-Kalam,&#8221; small and concise words, that Allah gave to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) 
  * You will send lots of salawaat on the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). [The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: The people who will be nearest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often for me.&#8221;]

Allah (عز و جل) blessed our Ummah with a special gift. It is known as the &#8220;isnad,&#8221; the chain in which a hadith is narrated. The isnad is so important, as it relates to us how this hadith reached us. Abdullah ibn Mubarak said, &#8220;The isnad to me is part of the deen (religion), and if it wasn&#8217;t for the isnad, anyone would say anything he wanted.&#8221;

This course is the best way to become closer to and love the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and also cling to his sunnah. Imam Malik said, &#8220;The Sunnah is like the Arc of Nuh, whoever boards it will be saved, and whoever stays behind will be drowned.&#8221;
