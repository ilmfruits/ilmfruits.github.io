In the first hadith in Sahih Bukhari, the messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;The **reward** of deeds **depends upon the intentions** and every person will **get the reward** according to **what he intended**. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> The majority scholarly opinion is that this hadith applies to **all actions**, natural or religious (read more about the distinction [here][1]).

**Based on your intention,** the end result of your action can be one of three things:

  1. **Reward:** If your intention is to please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), then all _good_ actions will be rewarded (actions not in compliance with Shari&#8217;ah will be rejected). For example, if you intend to read a book of seerah because seeking knowledge is an obligation on all Muslims, inshaAllah you will be **rewarded** in the akhira for it.
  
    In this case, if something **sabotages** your intention&#8211;like <dfn title="showing off; a form of minor shirk">riyaa</dfn>&#8211;it can **undercut** your reward.
  2. **Neutral:** If you perform an action with the intention for other then Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)&#8211;such as if you make a business trip to some city&#8211;your action will result in **neither reward nor punishment**.
  
    In this case, if you **change your intention** to be something good&#8211;such as to earn money so you can support your family or spend it in the way of Allah&#8211;you can be **rewarded**.
  3. **Punishment:** If your intention is to _disobey_ Allah, you can be punished for the action in the akhira. For example, if you decide to go to the Las Vegas (or Niagra Falls) casino to enjoy a little gambling, your journey becomes haram from day one.

An excellent two-part [article][2] on Islamtoday.com sums this up: &#8220;**The greatest threat to our worship** is the threat of **insincerity**. We can do the **noblest of deeds** and make the **greatest of sacrifices**, but if our **intentions** are not right, those deeds become **stripped of virtue**. This can leave a person **without good deeds** on the Day of Judgment.&#8221;<sup>2</sup>

So what happens when insincerity creeps into your intentions? What can you do to stave it off?

  1. **Repent:** Make sincere, heart-felt repentance to Allah, and inshaAllah He will forgive you. Pray two rakaahs of tawbah. Vow never to make the same sabotaged intention again.
  2. **Make Du&#8217;a:** Pray to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to purify your intentions. If the issue is riyaa, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us a du&#8217;a for it:
  
    <img alt="Du'a for Shirk" id="image206" src="/wp-content/uploads/dua-protection-from-shirk.gif" />
  
    &#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge in You lest I should commit shirk with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for what I do unknowingly.&#8221;<sup>3</sup>
  3. **Fight the Insincerity:** Realize that an insincere action will not benefit you _at all_ in the hereafter. You might impress this or that person _temporarily_&#8211;but on the day of judgement, they won&#8217;t care about you, nor will they be able to help you. Read the hadith about the [first three people whose fate will be decided][3]<sup>4</sup> on the Day of Judgement and remind yourself that you don&#8217;t want to be like them.
  4. **Renew Your Intentions:** Remind yourself of your original pure motives, and think of the _tremendous reward_ that&#8217;s waiting for you, inshaAllah, if you stick to your motives. Always keep your intentions fresh, and know why you do what you do.
  5. **Never Despair:** Remember, if you truly wish for pure intentions, Allah is watching out for _you_. What more do you need?

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) protect us all from intentions that devoid our actions of good deeds and grant us sincerity in intentions and in our actions, ameen!

And remember: if you&#8217;re **not worried** about your intentions, then you might be in trouble.
