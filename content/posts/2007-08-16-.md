We sometimes forget the utter importance of salat in our lives. When was the last time you pondered about the greatness of this worship?

Allah subhana huwa ta&#8217;ala says:
  
 <font size="+2"></font>

<p align="center">
  <font size="+2"><strong>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلَاتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ</strong></font>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their Salat (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. [Surah al-Mu&#8217;minoon V.1-2]</em>
</p>

From the verse above we see that true success is only for the believers. And who are these believers? They are those establish salat with full [khusoo&#8217;][1].

If you continue to read this particular Surah, Allah subhana huwa ta&#8217;ala carries on listing the characteristics of the believer: the one who avoids falsehood, evil talk, and all that Allah has forbidden; the one who pays zakat; the one who guards his chastity, and the list goes on. The thing to note is that the first characteristic Allah chooses to describe a believer by is salat; the one who establishes it with full submissiveness and focus.

And so the question to ask is&#8230;**_are you a believer?_**<!--more-->
