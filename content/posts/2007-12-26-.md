 Looking for that special connection with Allah?  Can&#8217;t find that &#8220;I just can&#8217;t wait for the akhira&#8221; feeling?  Join us every Sunday inshallah as we look for it.

 Have you ever popped a CD into the car and listend to the stories of the righteous?  Those who wished for nothing more than to pray the long winter nights and fast the long summer days.  Do you wonder how on earth people could read an enitre juzz in one salaah?  The one quote that&#8217;s engrained in my mind comes from a righteous scholar of the past Ibrahim ibn Adamee who said  &#8220;If the kings knew the feeling we have in our heart, they would fight us for it.&#8221;

 That&#8217;s the feeling we&#8217;re looking for.  And so in week one, let us know what you do that gives you that feeling.  What connects you best with Allah.  Inshallah every sunday we&#8217;ll cover one of the topics you people mention to help us all find that special feeling.
