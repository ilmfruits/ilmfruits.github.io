The Qur&#8217;an and sunnah both praise knowledge. There are many blessings of knowledge&#8211;but first, we must define, &#8220;what IS knowledge?&#8221;

The Prophet said, in one hadith: &#8220;If Allah wants to do a favor to somebody, He bestows on him, the gift of **understanding** the <dfn title="way of life; in this case, Islam">deen</dfn>.&#8221; [Bukhari [9/92/415][1]]<sup>1</sup> From this hadith, we know that _knowledge_, as defined in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, refers to knowledge of Islam, and not secular knowledge (such as Chemistry or Meteorology. Which is not to say secular knowledge is not important&#8211;Muslims need it to live in a halal way).

So what are the blessings of knowledge?

<div class="miniTitle">
  Raised Status and Rank
</div>

In Surah Mujadila, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ
</div>

**Translation:** Allah will rise up, to (suitable) ranks (and degrees), those of you who believe and who **have been granted knowledge**. (Surah Al-Mujadila, verse 11)<sup>2</sup>

<div class="miniTitle">
  Superiority over All Beings
</div>

When Adam (عليه سلام) was created, the _jinns and angels_ prostrated to _him_. They had powers that he did not. Why, then, prostrate? Because Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) gave Adam the names of all things, and when He (سبحانه وتعالى) challenged the angels to name things, they couldn&#8217;t. This equates knowledge with superiority over all beings.

Similarly, In Surah Imran, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  شَهِدَ اللّهُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَالْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ الْعِلْمِ قَآئِمَاً بِالْقِسْطِ
</div>

**Translation:** There is no god but He: That is the witness of Allah, His angels, and **those endowed with knowledge,** stand firm on justice. (Surah Al-Imran, verse 18)<sup>3</sup>

Ibn al-Qayim says that this verse of the Qur&#8217;an praises people of knowledge more then any other verse. Why would he consider it as such?

  1. **Company:** People of knowledge are mentioned in the same company as Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and angels.
  2. **Testimony:** This testimony is the greatest testimony&#8211;there is nothing more noble, more grand, or more noteworthy then testifying to the oneness of Allah.
  3. **Praise:** Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) praises them by saying that they &#8220;stand firm on justice&#8221;.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Protected From False Desires
</div>

Read the story of Qarun in [surah Qasas][2], verses 70-79. Qarun was so rich, he needed _a team of bodybuilders_ to carry around the _keys_ to his treasure. He walked around in pomp with his entrouge. While those deceived by the dunya wished they, too, could have his wealth, the **people of knowledge** said &#8220;The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness.&#8221;<sup>4</sup> Eventually, a fissure opened up and swallowed Qarun, entrouge and all.

Similarly, In Surah Fatir, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاء
</div>

**Translation:** Those truly fear Allah, among His Servants, [are exclusively those] **who have knowledge**. (Surah Fatir, verse 28)<sup>5</sup>

The word &#8220;innamaa&#8221; here is means exclusivity. Knowledge brings hope, recognition, etc. that ignorance cannot. The **quantity** of worship may be the same, but not the **quality**; that quality comes from knowledge.

<div class="miniTitle">
  The Hadith from Abu Darda
</div>

A man came to Abu Darda (رضي الله عنه), a companion of the Prophet, and said &#8220;I came to you with the sole purpose of hearing a tradition that you heard from the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)&#8221;. Subhanallah, he traveled from Medina to Damascus&#8211;**a journey of one month**&#8211;to hear **one** hadith. And we don&#8217;t travel 10 feet to our bookshelves to retrieve the **compilations of ahadith** we own.

In any case, Abu Darda (رضي الله عنه) narrated the following hadith from the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم):

> If anyone travels on a road in search of knowledge, **Allah** will cause him to **travel on one of the roads of Paradise**. The **angels** will **lower their wings** in their great pleasure with one who seeks knowledge, the **inhabitants** of the heavens and the Earth and the fish in the deep waters will **ask forgiveness** for the learned man. The superiority of the learned man over the worshipper is like that of **the moon**, on the night when it is full, **over the rest of the stars**. The learned are the **heirs of the Prophets**, and the Prophets leave neither dinar nor dirham, leaving **only knowledge**, and he who takes it takes an **big fortune.** [Abu-Dawud [25/3634][3]]<sup>6</sup>

This hadith outlines multiple blessings:

  1. **Ease to Paradise:** Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) makes it easier on the one who seeks knowledge to reach Jannah. The more difficult the path for knowledge, the easier the road to Paradise.
  2. **Protection of Angels:** Angels are a sign of Allah&#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) mercy. Here, angels show that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is pleased with the person, and the lowering of the wings implies protection.
  3. **Du&#8217;a of the Creatures:** We can all use more du&#8217;a &#8230;
  4. **Inheritence of the Prophets:** The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) left only seven silver coins, but a wealth of knowledge. And how do you inherit from the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)? Learn the knowledge he left behind.
  5. **The Full Moon Over the Stars:** Stars light the way when the moon is absent. But when the full moon appears, it&#8217;s light eclipses the stars completely. Similarly, the learned man (&#8216;alim) **eclipses** the worshipper (&#8216;abid). Why? The &#8216;abid **benefits himself,** but the &#8216;alim **benefits the entire community.** Consider the example of Imam Bukhari&#8211;how many people did he, may Allah have mercy on him, benefit?

May Allah increase us all in our knowledge and in the benefit we bring to the sons of Adam, ameen.
