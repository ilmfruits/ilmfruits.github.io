One of the things we need to understand about Arabic culutre is the significance of the number &#8220;seven.&#8221; This boils over into our understanding of ahadith.

First, a strong disclaimer: **Islam has nothing to do with numerology** &#8212; that is, the study and assignment of arbitrary numbers to the value of letters of the Arabic alphabet &#8212; such as the popular &#8220;786&#8221; which represents &#8220;bismillah.&#8221;

Nor should numbers be interpreted symbolically or otherwise, unless there is a very good, strong reason for doing so &#8212; such as with number seven.

* * *

Now that that&#8217;s out of the way: the number seven appears alone, and in multiples (70, 700, 70k, etc.) in several ahadith.

Let&#8217;s take a quick browse. For example, this famous hadith which comes to play in aqeedah mentions the number 73:

> Narrated AbuHurayrah:
  
> The Prophet () said: The Jews were split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects; and the Christians were split up into seventy one or seventy-two sects; and my community will be split up into seventy-three sects. ([Sunan Abu Dawud][1]) 

Other hadith mention 70,000:

> Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:
  
> Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;Hell will be brought on that Day (the Day of Resurrection) with seventy bridles (leashes); and with every bridle will be seventy thousand angels, pulling it.&#8221; ([Saheeh Muslim][2])

In these cases, and cases where the number seven is listed (seven itself or a multiple of seven &#8212; 70, 700, 7000, 70,000, etc.), **the number seven signifies a large quantity &#8212; a lot.** It does not _literally_ mean 70 or 70k; it can mean a large number.

And Allah knows best. If you search books of hadith for the number seven and its multiples, you will actually find this occur in a lot of ahadith. So keep this in the back of your mind when you read.
