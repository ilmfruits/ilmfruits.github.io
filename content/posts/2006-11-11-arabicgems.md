For those who have a little bit of understanding about the Arabic language, or wish to deepen their understanding, you may wish to venture into the [ArabicGems blog][1].

This blog covers different gems gleaned from the Qur&#8217;an based on the Arabic language. Subhanallah, it really helps you realize the miraculous nature of the Qur&#8217;an&#8211;how every phrase or even word articulates waves of meaning, and how translations don&#8217;t even begin to convey everything. It really should motivate us to learn the language of the Qur&#8217;an.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) bless them for their incredible work and increase us all in our depth of understanding of the Qur&#8217;an, ameen!
