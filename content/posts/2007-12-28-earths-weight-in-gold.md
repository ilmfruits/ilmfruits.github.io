excerpt: 'Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - never would the [whole] capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would [seek to] ransom himself with it. [Surah Al-Imran, verse 91]  Think about it.  The CAPACITY OF THE EARTH, in gold.  How much gold is that?  More then you if you win a $200 billion lottery every second of your life.'

Bismillah.

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم <strong>مِّلْءُ الأرْضِ</strong> ذَهَبًا وَلَوِ افْتَدَى بِهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers &#8211; never would the [whole] **capacity of the earth** in gold be accepted from one of them if he would [seek to] ransom himself with it. For those there will be a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers. [Surah Al-Imran, verse 91]

The word used for the **capacity of the earth** in this ayah is Mil al-Ard. &#8220;_Mil_&#8221; is used for the quantity that a vessel holds when it is filled; hence mil al-ard refers to the quantity/volume/mass/fill of the earth.

Those who die while they are disbelievers, Allah will accept no good deed ever from them, even if they gave the **earth&#8217;s fill of gold** as ransom. How much gold would that amount to? The earth&#8217;s fill.

Volume of the earth:

  * 1,083,206,246,123,080,894,852 m<sup>3</sup>
  * In words: 1 Septillion, 83 Sextillion, 206 quintillion, 246 trillion, 123 billion, 80 million, 894 thousand, 852 m<sup>3</sup>
  * Mass of the Earth: 5.98 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg (After 98, you would add 24 more zeros)
  * Price of one Ounce of Gold: $802.70 USD

Therefore, mass of the earth in Gold is worth = $1.65 x 10<sup>29</sup> USD (27 zeros after 65)

With this money, you could buy yourself **_all of_**:

  * 100 Ferraris ($168,000 each)
  * The most expensive house in the world ($155 million)
  * A Boeing A380 &#8211; huge double decker plane ($300 million)
  * The millennium star diamond (over a $100 million)
  * A trip to the moon ($100 million)
  * The international space station ($100 billion)

And now, you could do this for every single person of the six billion people on earth, and have spent only 0.000000366 % of your money.

You could have done all this a million times over and still have 97 % of your money left over.

It&#8217;s like winning a $200 billion lottery for every second of your life for 65 years.

We&#8217;re talking about an absolutely unfathomable amount of money. Does anyone on this planet have this much gold? Can anyone earn this much?

If a disbeliever gave <span class="gem">the earth&#8217;s fill of gold as ransom, it will not be accepted from him.</span>

Learn this lesson well: <span class="gem">The weight of <strong>emaan</strong> is more than Mil al-Ard. It&#8217;s more valuable. It&#8217;s priceless.</span>

_Jazakum Allahu khayran to my teachers for researching this._
