excerpt: 'Our purpose of creation is one and that is tawheed. Tawheed is making Allah One and Unique in His Lordship (Ruboobiyyah), in His Names and Attributes (Asmaa was Sifaat), and in His rights to be worshiped (Uloohiyyah). There are many blessings associated with tawheed, of them are: 1) Jannah 2) a means for sins to be forgiven 3) the right that Allah has over us 4) reason for sending Prophets and Books 5) dangers of its opposite - shirk.'

Our purpose of creation is one and that is tawheed. Tawheed is making Allah One and Unique in His Lordship (Ruboobiyyah), in His Names and Attributes (Asmaa was Sifaat), and in His rights to be worshiped (Uloohiyyah). There are many blessings associated with tawheed, of them are:

  1. Jannah
  2. a means for sins to be forgiven
  3. the right that Allah has over us
  4. the reason for sending Prophets and Books
  5. the dangers of its opposite &#8211; shirk
