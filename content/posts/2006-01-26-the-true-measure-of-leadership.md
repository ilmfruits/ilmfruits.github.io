  The true measure of leadership is influence, nothing more, and nothing less.
</p>

When you can influence people, you&#8217;re a leader, even if nobody recognizes you. And when you can&#8217;t influence people, you&#8217;re _not_ a leader &#8212; even if the masjid says so, or the organization says so, or your friends say so, or your car says so.

And remember the command of the Prophet, peace be upon him: Do not covet leadership, for it entails blame, regret, and punishment on the Day of Judgement &#8212; except for the just ruler.
