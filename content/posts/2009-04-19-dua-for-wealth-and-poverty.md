**Note:** This is the 5th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma.

In our last post, we talked about how the human race does taghaa if they see themselves as self-sufficient. Living in western societies, we see this all around us&#8211;people racing, fighting, stealing, overworking, to make a few more dollars so that they can &#8220;make it.&#8221; They buy lottery tickets so they can &#8220;make it&#8221; and be rich, rich rich!

Did you know, the Prophet Dawud (alayhi salaam) used to make du&#8217;a:

> اللهمّا أعوذُ بِكَ مِن غُنَن يُطغِي و فِقرٍ يُنسِي
  
> Allahumma a&#8217;oothu bika min ghunan yutghee wa fiqrin yunsee 

**Translation:** O Allah, I seek refuge in you from wealth that makes one tyrannical, and poverty that makes one forget. [Recorded in Kitaab ad Du&#8217;a by Abdullah ibn Abu Shaybah]

What does this du&#8217;a mean? Ghunan yutghee means wealth that makes one tyrannical&#8211;because if humans see themselves as self-sufficient, this is what happens!

And &#8220;poverty that makes one forget?&#8221; If you&#8217;ve ever seen people in a bad financial position, struggling to overcome debts, credit-card payments, interest loans, sometimes out of the pressure of the moment, they forget ALL of Allah&#8217;s favours on them, and it makes them into a tyrant.

**Action Items:**

  * **Memorize this du&#8217;a.** It&#8217;s very short and easy; if you remember the gist of it, you just need to remember &#8220;ghunan yutghee wa faqrun yunsee.&#8221;
  * **Reflect.** Are you falling into the trap of seeking wealth? Are you so sure it will benefit you? Is it already making you creep towards the edge of tughyaan?

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
