excerpt: "The greatest command after that of tawheed is of salaah. Allah lays out a list for whom this Qur'an is a guidance, and amongst the first things He says are about those who establish the salaah; those who guard them strictly and stand in front of Allah with obedience. The example of Prophet Ibrahim (عليه السلام) is amongst the best, and as he builds the ka'ba, he makes du'a to Allah to make him amongst those who establish salaah. "

The greatest command after that of tawheed is of salaah. Allah lays out a list for whom this Qur&#8217;an is a guidance, and amongst the first things He says are about those who establish the salaah; those who guard them strictly and stand in front of Allah with obedience. The example of Prophet Ibrahim (عليه السلام) is amongst the best, and as he builds the ka&#8217;ba, he makes du&#8217;a to Allah to make him amongst those who establish salaah.

Listen to the podcast to learn MORE about why Prophet Ibrahim, the khalil of Allah, made this du&#8217;a, and what that means for you and me.
