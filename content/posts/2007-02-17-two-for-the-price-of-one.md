Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً<br /> إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً
</div>

**Translation:** So verily, with the hardship, there is relief; Verily, with the hardship, there is relief! [Surah Ash-Shrah, verses 5-6]

Two for the price of one! How&#8217;s _that_ for a deal?

So if you find yourself in a position of hardship, ask yourself: What ease am I forgetting?

And also, the use of <dfn title="مَعَ">with</dfn>, shows that the two are so closely related as to be companions&#8211;they are together! [1]

And Allah is the source of peace, As-Salaam.
