  Love of Allah

Ibn al-Qaiyim (رحمالله) mentioned ten causes that result in Allah&#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) love for His slave and the slave&#8217;s love for his Lord. [These ten are:]

First, recite the Qur&#8217;an while pondering over its meanings and what is meant by it.

Second, get closer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) by performing voluntary deeds after completing obligatory deeds. This is as is stated in a Hadith Qudsi: &#8220;My slave continues getting closer to Me by performing voluntary deeds until I love him.&#8221; [al-Bukhari]

Third, continually remember Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) under all circumstances, with one&#8217;s tongue, heart and actions. The extent of one&#8217;s love of Allah is determined by this.

Fourth, favour what He loves over what you love when you are overtaken by your desires.

Fifth, cultivate a heart avid of Allah&#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) Names, and Attributes and a heart that roams in that garden of knowledge.

Sixth, observe Allah&#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) kindness, goodness and bounties, both hidden and open.

Seventh, and this is the most wonderful, acquire a soft heart, subdued and meek before Allah.

Eighth, be alone with Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) during the time when the Lord descends during the last portion of the night while reading His Book and ending that by asking for forgiveness and with repentance.

Ninth, sit with the beloved and sincere, benefit from the most fruitful of their speech. And do not speak unless speaking is more beneficial and you know that it will improve your state and be beneficial to others.

Tenth, remain away from every cause that comes between the heart and Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).

These ten causes take the lovers to the station of true love and bring them to their Beloved.
