After years of dawah the people of Nuh (عليه سلام), Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) revealed to Nuh (عليه سلام) (interpretation of the meaning) &#8220;None of thy people will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their (evil) deeds.&#8221; (Surah Hud, verse 35)

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) instructed Nuh (عليه سلام) to build an ark, and that the sinners will drown in a flood. As Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) states in Qur&#8217;an (to the interpretation of the meaning): &#8220;But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood).&#8221; Allah later stated (to the interpretation of the meaning): &#8220;At length behold! There came Our Command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: &#8216;Embark therein of each kind two, male and female, and your family, except those against whom the Word has already gone forth and the Believers.&#8217; But only a few believed with him.&#8221; (Surah Hud, verse 37)

Allah states in Qur&#8217;an (to the interpretation of the meaning): &#8220;The waves picked up the ark. At time of departure, Nuh (عليه سلام) asked his son to join them. So the Ark floated with them on the waves (towering) like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who separated himself (from the rest): &#8216;O my son! Embark with us, and be not with the Unbelievers!&#8217; The son replied: &#8216;I will be take myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water.&#8217; Noah said: &#8216;This day nothing can save from the Command of Allah, any but those on whom He hath mercy!&#8217;― and the waves came between them, and the son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood.&#8221; (Surah Hud, verse 42-43)

Then Allah commanded the earth to swallow the water, the ark landed on Mouth Judi. Upon stopping, Nuh (عليه سلام) asked Allah (to the interpretation of the meaning) &#8220;O my Lord! Surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true and Thou art the Justest of Judges!&#8221;. Allah&#8217;s reply to Nuh was (to the interpretation of the meaning) &#8220;O Noah! He is not of thy family, for his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou become one of the ignorant!&#8221; (Surah Hud, verses 45-46)

Allah defines the meaning of family. <span class="gem">Our family is not only our father, mother, brother, or sister. It is instead all the believers.</span> Let he/she be brown, black, white, or of other races on this earth.
