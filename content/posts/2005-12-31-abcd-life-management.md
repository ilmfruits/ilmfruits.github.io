[This article][1] by Steve Pavlina explains how to effectively manage your life by focusing on tasks based on their long-term effects.

The article defines three categories of tasks, and allocates your daily time to each of them proportionally based on their expected benefit.

  1. **&#8220;A&#8221; tasks** yield benefit in five or more years, such as learning a new language.
  2. **&#8220;B&#8221; tasks** yield benefit in two or more years, such as training for a marathon.
  3. **&#8220;C&#8221; tasks** yield benefit in 90 days or less. This includes day-to-day tasks, like checking email.

He supports a 50-30-20 method of time-sharing: allocate 50% of your time for A tasks, 30% of your time to B tasks, and 20% of your time to C tasks.

As Muslims, we know the hadith of the Prophet, (صلي الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;There are two things humans are decieved by: their health, and their time.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> In addition, we focus long-long-long-term, on the _Akhira_ (afterlife). How do you categorize tasks like praying _salaah_?

I suggest a fourth category of **&#8220;D&#8221; Tasks:** tasks that bear fruit in the _Akhira_ mainly, and in the _dunya_ (world) marginally. D tasks are usually _fard_ (obligatory: you get rewarded if you perform them, and punished if you abstain from them) and _mustahab_ (you get rewarded if you do them, but no punishment if you abstain from them). Therefore, D tasks should be first-priority, over A tasks.

Wallahu &#8216;alim. I find this form of time management helps you complete those mundane tasks on your to-do list that idle for days and weeks.
