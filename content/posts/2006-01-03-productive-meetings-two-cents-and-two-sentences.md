To optimize your meetings and keep them clear, concise, and on-topic, follow the following two rules as much as possible:

**Two Cents:** _Keep your two cents out of it._ Nobody wants to hear your opinion anyway, and spewing one opinion denies other opinions their right. When you compound personal opinion with rebuttal with re-rebuttal, your main topic quickly derails. (Never tolerate deviations from this rule.)

**Two Sentences:** _When you speak, l__imit_ _your dialogue to two sentences max._ Power comes with being concise. This forces you to think about your statements before you say them, and prevents you from getting far off topic whenever you choose to speak. (Ignore occasional deviations from this rule.)

If everyone in your meeting understands, agrees, and follows these rules, _bi ithnillah_ (by the permission of Allah), you&#8217;ll find your productivity increases almost exponentially.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
