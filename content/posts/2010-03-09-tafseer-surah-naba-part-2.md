This is post #40 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).

In the previous post, we discussed the first 16 verses of Surah Naba&#8217;. The remaining 24 verses discuss the Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire; you should read them to extract the details. Insha&#8217;Allah we&#8217;re going to touch on a few points that are interesting.

First, a recap&#8211;verse 16 talked about (a continuing discussion of) some of the blessings of Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) in the dunya on the people. Then&#8211;_WHAM!_&#8211;verse 17 says:

> إِنَّ يَوْمَ الْفَصْلِ كَانَ مِيقَاتًا

**Translation:** Indeed, the Day of Judgement is an appointed time. [Surah An-Naba&#8217;, verse 17]

Suddenly, the topic shifts seamlessly into the Hereafter. Some gems to extract from this verse:

  * **Yawm Al-Fasl:** The Day of Judgment is called Yawmul Fasli. What&#8217;s the meaning of fasl? Arabic students will say &#8220;aha! it means class!&#8221; But what does it _really_ mean? The root verb is (I believe) fasala, which means to differentiate, to distinguish, to split apart into levels; this, class&#8211;students of different levels. And Yawmul-Fasl? The day that the people will be divided into groups and nations and successful and unsuccessful.
  * **An Appointment:** Meeqat is a word familiar to all the hujjaaj&#8211;it means an appointed place (in the context of Hajj), i.e. the points at which Ihram must go on. It can also mean an appointed time; here, Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) is saying, the Day of Judgment is scheduled _at an appointment._ It won&#8217;t run late. It won&#8217;t surprise you early; if anything, it&#8217;s _already decided_ when it will happen, down to the nanosecond &#8230;

Then Allah (subhannahu wa ta&#8217;ala) continues:

> يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ فَتَأْتُونَ أَفْوَاجًا

**Translation:** The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes. [Surah Naba, verse 18]

The phrase &#8220;yunfakhu fis-soor,&#8221; might confuse you; yunfakhu is clearly a Baab I word in the passive form (it was done); but with a harf-ul-jarr? In English, we don&#8217;t really say things like &#8220;the balloon was blown into,&#8221; but this is precisely the Arabic construct.

As-Soor means, well, a trumpet; what kind of trumpet is not important. The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the meaning of: &#8220;How can I enjoy myself anything, when the angel has already put the trumpet (As-Soor) into his mouth and has taken a breath and stands with his eyes fixed on the throne of Ar-Rahman, waiting for the instant that the command will be given, to blow?&#8221; So the sahaba said, &#8220;What should we say O Messenger of Allah (since the end of the world is so close)?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Say: hasbunallaha wa ni&#8217;ma al-wakeel,&#8221; Allah is sufficient for us and he is Al-Wakeel (the one who takes care of all your affairs).&#8221; [Source unknown]

After describing more of the horrors of the Day of Judgment, Allah says:

> إِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ كَانَتْ مِرْصَادً

**Translation:** Indeed, Hell has been lying in wait. [Verse 21]

Mirsaad is a word known very well by the Arabs of that time &#8212; and by anyone who plays first-person shooter games. If you&#8217;re riding down a road, and people spring out of nowhere and ambush you &#8212; that&#8217;s mirsaad. Ambush. So we see that Hellfire is a creature; it&#8217;s not just some passive flames &#8212; but rather, it will _ambush_ those who are walking through life, unaware, that it&#8217;s just waiting around the corner.

A couple of verses later, describing the fare of the people of Hellfire, Allah says:

> لَّابِثِينَ فِيهَا أَحْقَابًا
  
> لَّا يَذُوقُونَ فِيهَا بَرْدًا وَلَا شَرَابًا
  
> إِلَّا حَمِيمًا وَغَسَّاقًا
  
> جَزَاءً وِفَاقًا 

**Translation:** In which they will remain for ages [unending]. They will not taste therein [any] coolness or drink, Except scalding water and [foul] purulence &#8211; An appropriate recompense. [Surah An-Naba&#8217;, verses 23-26]

We already discussed the food of the people of Hellfire &#8212; long, spiky, poisonous fare; and their drink &#8212; boiling water, and the juices of the roasting people of Hellfire. And then Allah says: &#8220;Jazaa&#8217;an wifaaqaa,&#8221; an **exact and perfect repayment** for them.

And this shows that they are the most evil people &#8212; that Allah does not wrong them anything or give them more or less than they deserve; and _this_ is what they deserve.

We seek Allah&#8217;s refuge in being from among those people.

If you could interview those people now and ask them, &#8220;why are you here?&#8221; Or, statistically, what trend or trait lead to these people being in Hellfire? Wouldn&#8217;t you want to know, so you could avoid that trait?

Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) explains:

> إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا لَا يَرْجُونَ حِسَابًا 

**Translation:** Indeed, they were not expecting an account. [Verse 27]

Hisaab is the taking-to-account that _every human being will go through_ on the Day of Judgment. It&#8217;s referred to as &#8220;reckoning,&#8221; &#8220;taking to account,&#8221; or similar phrases in translations.

One of the things we learn from studying the verses addressing ahlul-kitaab, is that the verses don&#8217;t just address them; they address **anyone who has the same characteristics that they have.** So if _you&#8217;re_ Muslim, and you&#8217;re not worried about your hisaab &#8230; that&#8217;s a very dangerous place to be; Allah (&#8216;azza wa jal) says to these people who denied the truth:

> فَذُوقُوا فَلَن نَّزِيدَكُمْ إِلَّا عَذَابًا 

**Translation:** &#8220;So taste [the penalty], and never will We increase you except in torment.&#8221; [Surah An-Naba&#8217;, verse 30]

This is a very scary verse. Think about it. Punishment only gets _more_ intense in Hellfire. The easiest part is the beginning; it gets progressively worse and worse and worse. You ask for food? You have to choke down poisonous spikes. You ask for water? You get hameem and ghassaq. You ask for a lighter punishment? You get **more** punishment.

May Allah protect us all from the punishment of Hellfire.

Insha&#8217;Allah we will wrap up Surah Naba&#8217; in our next post, and then on to other suraat in this juz.
