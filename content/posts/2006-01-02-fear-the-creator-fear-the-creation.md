  &#8220;If you fear the creator, you will never fear the creation.&#8221; -Imam Anwar al-Awlaki
</p>

If your heart trembles in fear of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and awe of His majesty, nothing in the _dunya_ (world) can ever overshadow that fear. The _dunya_ can throw a bigger army at you, better weapons, everything and anything. And if you fear Allah the way He deserves to be feared, none of that can overshadow your fear of the Creator.

By the way, _taqwa_, commonly translated as &#8220;fear&#8221;, means to fear something in order to protect yourself from it. Wallahu &#8216;alim.
