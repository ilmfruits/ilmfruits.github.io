  As Islamic workers, we never lower our standers. Not as volunteers, not as professionals, and not as Muslims.
</p>

Always strive to the best of your abilities. And inshaAllah this way, your skills and talent grow faster than if you barely use them.

Never fall into the trap of so many people who produce second-rate material &#8220;just because&#8221; it&#8217;s for Islamic work, and not for their own (percieved/worldly) benefit.

And remember: ihsaan means excellence, not perfection. Only Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is perfect.
