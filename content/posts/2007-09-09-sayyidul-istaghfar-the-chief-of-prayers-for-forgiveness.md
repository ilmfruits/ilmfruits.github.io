excerpt: "The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us sayyidul istighfar, the du'a that, if we recite in the day with certainty and die in the night (or recite in the night with certainty and die in the day), allows us to enter Jannah.  What is this beautiful pearl from the sunnah?"

One of the greatest gifts that Allah has blessed us with is the ability to make tawbah and istaghfar after committing sins continuously. He (سبحانه وتعالى) has taught our forefather Adam (عليه السلام) the words of repentance and He taught Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) a very special dua. The dua is called the sayyidul istaghfar, and it is one of the pearls from the Sunnah that we should know.

> On the authority of Shaddad ibn Aws (رضالله عنهم) the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, “The chief of prayers for forgiveness is:
> 
> <dfn title="O Allah, You are my Lord, none has the right to be worshiped except You.">Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa Ant</dfn>
  
> <dfn title="You created me and I am You servant">Khalaqatani wa ana &#8216;abduka</dfn>
  
> <dfn title="and I abide to Your covenant and promise as best I can">wa ana &#8216;ala &#8216;ahdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu</dfn>
  
> <dfn title="I take refuge in You from the evil of which I committed">audhobika min sharri ma sana&#8217;atu</dfn>
  
> <dfn title="I acknowledge Your favor upon me">abu ooh laka bi ni&#8217;matika &#8216;alayya</dfn>
  
> <dfn title="and I acknowledge my sin">wa abu ooh bi zanbi</dfn>
  
> <dfn title="so forgive me">faghfir lee</dfn> <dfn title="for verily none can forgive sin except You.">fa innahu la yaghfiruz zunooba illa Ant</dfn>
> 
> The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) added, <span class="gem">&#8220;If somebody recites it during the day with firm faith in it and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the people of Paradise and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it and dies before the morning he will be from the people of Paradise.&#8221;</span>

Wow! Subhan Allah! Is this beautiful dua part of your daily life? We should make a habit of at least saying it once or twice a day, and maybe even more&#8230;and saying it like we mean it. May Allah accept from us, ameen.
