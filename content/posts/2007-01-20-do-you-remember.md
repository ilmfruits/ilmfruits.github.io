Why are we on this earth? This time, this place. People, make the use of the situation based on a cycle. The EAT-WORK-SLEEP cycle, which I believe turns out to be boring. Monday work starts, lasts till friday. Then again the same old weekend, were some claim to enjoy.

Or lets look at life as a whole. A person is born, goes to school, goes to university/ college, gets a job. marries, buys a house and he/ she starts a new person&#8217;s cycle (their kids).
  
The same old story again and again.
  
So again what are we doing here? When Allah created us he sent us down with something, can you remember?

Ibn Abbas (ضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) related that,
  
&#8220;When Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) created Adam (عليه سلام), He took a covenant from him in a place called Na&#8217;man on the day of Arafah. Then He extracted from him all of descendants who would be born until the end of the world, generation after generation, and spread them out in front of Him in order to take a covenant from them also. He spoke to them face to face saying: &#8216;Am I not your Lord?&#8217; and they all replied, &#8216;Yes, we testify to it.&#8217; Allah then explained why He had all of mankind bear witness that He was their creator and only true God worthy of worship. He said, &#8216;That was in case you (mankind) should say on the Day of Resurrection, &#8216;Surely we were unaware of all this. We had no idea that You, Allah , were our God. No one told us that we were supposed to worship You alone.&#8221; Allah went on to explain that it was also in case some people would say: &#8216;It was our ancestors who made partners (with Allah) and we are only their descendants; will you then destroy us for what those liars did?&#8217; (Collected by Ahmed, Classified sahih, see Silsilah al-Albani&#8217;s al-Ahadith as-Sahihah)

Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said this in an explanation of the verses (interpretation of the meaning): And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam&#8217;s loin his offspring) and made them testify as to themselves (saying): &#8220;Am I not your Lord?&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes! We testify,&#8221; lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: &#8220;Verily, we have been unaware of this.&#8221; Or lest you should say: &#8220;It was only our fathers afortime who took others as partners in worship along with Allah, and we were (merely their) descendants after them; will You then destroy us because of the deeds of men who practised Al-Batil (i.e. polytheism and committing crimes and sins, invoking and worshipping others besides Allah)?&#8221; (Tafsir At-Tabari). (Qur&#8217;an 7: 172-173)
  
The explanation and the ayah&#8217;s are clear proof for people, that the reason we are on earth is not for any other than recognizing Allah as our Lord, and worship Him.

Now it can be seen that MUSLIMS are so much into the EAT-WORK-SLEEP cycle. And they go on and on, with the same old reasons, a good house, a good car (which are mostly mortgage based). So lets remember ( and I advive myself first) why we are here, because if we do, and abide by it, then the rewards we will receive will be infinite , unlike the perceived rewards of this world, which are limited and fragile.
