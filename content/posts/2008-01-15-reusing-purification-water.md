Can you re-use water used for purification&#8211;wudoo or ghusl? This issue doesn&#8217;t apply to most people unless they&#8217;re stuck somewhere without much water&#8211;like Cambodia, where they get water _once a year_, during flood season, and keep it for nine months.

(Before you read this, read about the three-fold categorization of water; in summary, water can either be purifying (tuhoor), pure (taahir), or impure (najas), and we can only use purifying water for wudoo and ghusl.)

**Scholars agree** that, if **the water changes**&#8211;the colour, smell, or taste change due to najaasa&#8211;then **the water is najas**, and you can&#8217;t use it. And **water that remains free of impurity** is recyclable.

But what if some najas falls into it, and it _doesn&#8217;t_ change colour? For example, you&#8217;re washing your son/nephew/grandson, and a few drops of urine fall into your bucket of wudoo water&#8211;but the water doesn&#8217;t change in it&#8217;s three characteristics.

Is it pure?

**Scholars disagree** on this. Let&#8217;s blitz through some of the opinions:

**Opinion 1:** the water remains pure even if 100 people make wudoo with it 100,000 times&#8211;because as long as the three characteristics are the same, it&#8217;s still purifying water! They quote the following proofs:

Hadith: Water is purifying, and nothing will defile it.

Hadith: Aisha (رضالله عنها) narrates that she used some water to wash when she was in a state of janabah. The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Water does not come into the state of janabah,&#8221; i.e. it doesn&#8217;t carry impurity or become impure and remains purifying. [Musnan of Ibn Ahmad]

Hadith: Urwa ibn Mas&#8217;ood As-Sa&#8217;id met the Prophet, then said to the Quraish: &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) performed his wudoo, his companions rushed to share the water he used.&#8221; [Bukhari, Musnad of Imam Ahmad]

Also, the default opinion with water is that it&#8217;s purifying, until proven impure.

**Opinion 2:** Water becomes pure, but not purifying (like tea or coke). While it&#8217;s not najas, you can&#8217;t make wudoo or ghusl from it. They quote the following proofs:

Hadith: Don&#8217;t urinate in stagnant water and wash yourself with it.

(Meaning, even if the water looks pure, you can&#8217;t make wudoo with it.)

**Opinion 3:** Water already used for purifying becomes najas. (So if you make wudoo and drip water from your elbow onto your clothes, you need to re-wash them.) They use the same hadith above as proof&#8211;because one of their principles is &#8220;Any time Allah or the Prophet put two things together in a sentence, they take the same ruling.&#8221; But there are many ayaat in the Qur&#8217;an where this isn&#8217;t true, so this is a very weak proof.

So what&#8217;s the conclusion? Allahu &#8216;alim, scholars put forward **opinion one&#8211;you can reuse wudoo water so long as it&#8217;s characteristics don&#8217;t change**&#8211;because the ahadith that speak directly about this topic are many and strong; you can&#8217;t get a better proof then that.

So if a little bit of something najas falls into your bathtub or wudoo bucket, don&#8217;t freak out&#8211;remember, _it&#8217;s all good!_ (It&#8217;s still purifying.)

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alim.
