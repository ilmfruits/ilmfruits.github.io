  Rizq Management
</div>

[Rizq Management][1] is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Muhammad Alshareef. The course focuses on three pillars of Islam: <dfn title="a tax imposed on assets for the benefit of the poor">Zakaah</dfn>, <dfn title="fasting (especially in the month of Ramadan)">Siyaam</dfn>, and <dfn title="pilgrimage to the Ka'bah">Hajj</dfn>. Which moon opinion is correct&#8211;one of them? _All_of them? Does chewing gum break your fast? (Why or why not?) Does a woman pay zakaah on her gold jewelry?

Learn about these three fundamental pillars of Islam, and how to not only _perform_, but how to _benefit_ from them at the highest level!
