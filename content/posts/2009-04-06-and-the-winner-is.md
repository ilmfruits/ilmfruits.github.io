Bismillah.

The results of the poll are in! And it&#8217;s &#8230; it&#8217;s &#8230;

**_It&#8217;s a four-way tie._**

The winners are:

  * Arabic Language
  * Islamic Finance
  * Uloom-ul-Qur&#8217;an
  * Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma

I was really hoping for a clear-cut winner &#8230; but insha&#8217;Allah khayr. I spent a while thinking about it, taking shura from different people, looking at different factors (such as what information I can easily access and benefit from), and here&#8217;s what I decided:

  * **Arabic Language:** It&#8217;s hard to come up with a curriculum of this where you can teach people in short posts, yet with benefit to them. But instead of rejecting it outright, I intend to integrate blobs of Arabic knowledge into each post, insha&#8217;Allah.
  * **Uloom-ul-Qur&#8217;an:** After reviewing my notes, I find it difficult to come up with material that we can apply every day. This is an interesting and multi-faceted science, but one that&#8217;s difficult (in my view) to gem-ify and apply &#8230; so it&#8217;s out. It also contains issues like abrogation in the Qur&#8217;an and the compilation of the Qur&#8217;an that should be discussed in proper academic/Islamic environments, not just thrown up on a blog.
  * **Islamic Finance:** This is one of my favourite branches, and one that I really love a lot and benefit from a lot. Despite the difficulty, the applicability and ubiquity in our lives is amazing! Yet, this, too, is not the winner. That leaves &#8230;
  * **Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma:** I decided on this because, well, it&#8217;s the Qur&#8217;an. And every Muslim desires to learn more about and understand the Qur&#8217;an. Plus, these are surahs that many of us recite almost every salah; shouldn&#8217;t we, then, know the meanings and details of them?

So insha&#8217;Allah our series begins tomorrow on **Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma.** I will post up a curriculum insha&#8217;Allah of what topics we&#8217;ll study, and what benefits we hope to derive, bi idhnillah, in a day or two.

I want to say jazakumullahu khayran to everybody who participated, both in voting and in posting comments. Insha&#8217;Allah there will be khayr in all.

**Action Items:** Post a comment and let us know what surahs you are interested in learning more about, or what aspects, or whatever it is in Juz Amma that interests you and you&#8217;d like to learn at a deeper level.
