We live in a society where communication is a mandatory skill for achieving success. We learn out to address the people around us, to attain the jobs we want or acheivements we desire. However, in these times of essential communication skills, we take the most simplest acts of proper manners for granted when it comes to being kind to all people. Take for example our style of speaking with our friends, our family, our spouse, or our parents, how does that compare to other groups of people in our life? How do we address those whom we hold an instant dislike, perhaps for something they did to us or perhaps due to some minor reason that has long been forgotten to us. Do we give them a cold shoulder What about people who we dislike or who are not the greatest people towards others? No doubt, our instinctive desire is to be harsh with them in return.

THe question to be asked while facing such thoughts is what would the prophet (saw) do in a situation as such. Would he reply back rudely to a person who bashes you or would he be quiet?
