Or could it be the smile on his face which never tarnished away? Many people smile. Take our librarian, for instance. What did he have? Why did I feel so close to him; as if we had been friends forever. It was only the first meeting. Wait. On a second thought, it wasn&#8217;t really the first meeting. I had always met him in my dreams, longed to be in his company. How beautiful was that day. He asked me my name. He felt interested in me while listening to all I said and never once did he interrupt me. Never let a frown appear on his face. I only realize this now. I cannot imagine his face without a smile. A smile so pure and sincere that it won my heart at once. Or maybe it was his openness. His generosity. After writing me his contact info, he even gifted me the pen. Why did he do this? What was he getting by being nice to me? I wonder. The irony is that he never spent a lot on me. He didn&#8217;t buy me a toy or paid for my dinner. He didn&#8217;t even give me a candy, but he played with me. He gave me a gift of time and that of love. And now that I think of it, of teaching me how to incline people and connect them to Allah.
