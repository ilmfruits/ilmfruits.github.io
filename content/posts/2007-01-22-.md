Bismillah.

If any of you have, or know someone who wants to study in an Islamic university overseas&#8211;say, Medinah&#8211;one of the most common &#8220;fears&#8221; CNN puts into people is that you&#8217;ll get &#8220;brainwashed.&#8221;

But subhanallah, is there any truth to this?

One alumni of Medinah, shaykh Muhammad Alshreef, explained this: he said that by the time students reach fourth year, they are _impossible to teach._

Why?

Because they **question and challenge absolutely everything you say.** They don&#8217;t just accept your opinion.

What&#8217;s _more_, let&#8217;s take a look at a sample of three shuyookh, all Alumni from Medinah (which has its own reputation), on just three unrelated matters. The shuyookh are: Muhammad Alshareef (faculty of Shari&#8217;ah), Yasir Qadhi (faculty of Aqeedah), and Abdool Hamid (faculty of Hadith).

Check this out:

**Muhammad Alshareef:** You absolutely _cannot_ go for Hajj when you have debts. No way.
  
**Abdool Hamid:** It is _recommended_ that you pay off your debts first, but it is in no way a barrier.

**Yasir Qadhi:** Zakaah values are based on _silver_, and you calculate the [nisab][1] from that.
