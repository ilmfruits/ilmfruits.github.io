Bismillah.

As mentioned in the last post, we&#8217;re going to start a series insha&#8217;Allah **Monday, April 13th** on the tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma, the 30th juz of the Qur&#8217;an.

Here&#8217;s what you can expect in the next while:

  * **The whole juz.** As much as possible, I will post gems, points, tafseer, etc. from _every single surah_ in this juz&#8211;even if it&#8217;s not necessarily the most actionable thing.
  * **Every single day.** Insha&#8217;Allah I will write one post _per day_, albeit shorter posts. This will hopefully make it easier to focus on different aspects and learn in more manageable pieces.
  * **Arabic language.** I will add points from the Arabic language&#8211;most probably explanations of words, but also perhaps some grammar&#8211;to each post. _Please make sure you give me feedback_ so I know how much is too much or too little.
  * **Uloom-ul-Qur&#8217;an.** I&#8217;ll mention, where it&#8217;s well-known with little difference of opinion, whether the surah was Mecci or Medini (i.e. revealed before or after the hijrah), and any reasons of revelation that may have occured.
  * **Gems.** As per regular Ilm Fruits style, the core information will contain gems and actionable items, insha&#8217;Allah, for you to take away, in typical Ilm Fruits style :)
  * **Test your Knowledge.** At the end of the series, we&#8217;ll have a short quiz or test on the material. This will help you know if you understand or don&#8217;t understand the material. Format will be decided later, but don&#8217;t be surprised if there is a short-answer or long-answer question on it :D </ul> 
    So with that, we&#8217;ll begin **Monday, April 13th** insha&#8217;Allah. Also, I want to stress that, because I intend to cover the entire juz, **the series will NOT end at the end of April.** It may take longer&#8211;a week, a month, I can&#8217;t say&#8211;but insha&#8217;Allah we will get it done.
    
    Are you excited?
