For those of you who regularly write Arabic (and, incidentally, you can generalize this to _any_ language inshallah), you might look at your writing and say, &#8220;man, that is ugggggleeeeeee!&#8221;

So how do you go about beautifying it? The key here is that **you can recognize nice Arabic writing when you see it**&#8211;and I don&#8217;t mean calligraphy.

The solution is surprisingly simple. Grab a <dfn title="book version of the Qur'an">mushaf</dfn> (or, if you have them, one of the three Medinah University Arabic books),   <span class="gem"><strong>Apply your observational skills</strong>, and you can <em>easily</em> inshallah detect a few clues on how to improve (or even how to write them!) Check out the letters below:<br /> </span>

![Thal-alif-noon-fatha][1]
  
What are some lessons we can learn from these few letters&#8211;noon, dhal, and alif?

  1. **The noon is not symmetrical**&#8211;rather, the right side is taller then the left! (You can see this more in the Medinah books inshallah.)
  2. **<dfn title="the Arabic vowels, the little things above/below letters">Harakaat</dfn> are slanted**&#8211;not flat horizontal, as I first thought.
  3. **Dhal has a straight back&#8211;**it doesn&#8217;t start out curved.
  4. **Dhal and alif are the same height**&#8211;meaning your dhals should fill the line from top to bottom, if you write on ruled paper.

Allah knows best, you can find more yourself with a bit of effort. Look at the letter itself&#8211;how did they write it? Where did they start? How does it look in relation to other letters?

And of course, unless you write regularly (even once a week is good), none of this will benefit you too much. Wallahu &#8216;alim.
