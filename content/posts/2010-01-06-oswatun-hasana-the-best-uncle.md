And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds. [21:107]

In the <a href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/oswatun-hasana-the-best-father" target="_blank">last post</a>, we looked at how our beloved prophet (SAW) set for us an excellent example as a father. <span><span>Inshallah</span></span>, continuing with the theme, in this post, we will explore two more roles:  **uncle and the master.
  
** 

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Treatment with niece</strong></span>

  * After the <span><span>Taif</span></span> Campaign, one of the captives As-<span><span>Shaima</span></span>, the daughter of Al-<span><span>Harith</span></span> As-Sa<span><span>diya</span></span>, the Messenger’s foster sister was brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) , she introduced herself to him. Upon recognizing her by a certain mark, he honored her, spread for her his garment and seated her on it. He was graceful and released her and made her turn back to her people. [The Sealed <span>Nectar</span>]

Amazing! For those of us, who have the nieces, do we treat them with the respect, honor and love? How about with our own sisters? Note that As-<span><span>Shaima was the daughter of the <strong>foster</strong> sister and yet the prophet (SAW) treated her with so much kindness.<br /> </span></span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Treatment with servant:</strong></span>

  * <span><span>Anas</span></span> reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had the best disposition amongst people. He sent me on an errand one day, and I said:  By Allah, I would not go. I had, however, this idea in my mind that I would do as Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had commanded me to do. I went out until I happened to come across children who had been playing in the street. In the meanwhile, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came there and he caught me by the back of my neck from behind me. As I looked towards him I found him smiling and he said: <span><span>Unais</span></span>, did you go where I commanded you to go? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes, I am going. <span><span>Anas</span></span> further said: <span style="color: #0000ff;">I served him for nine years but I know not that he ever said to me about a thing which I had done why I did that, or about a thing I had left as to why I had not done that</span>. [Muslim]

<span><span>Subhanallah</span></span>, how many of us actually do that? When we are given a position of authority, be it be at work (supervisor, manager, business owners) or at home, how do we treat the people under us? Are we gentle, merciful and forgiving. We need to learn from our beloved Prophet (SAW).
