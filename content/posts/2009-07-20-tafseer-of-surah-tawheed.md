_This is post #23 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series)._

Allah says, in Surah Tawheed, also known as Surah Ikhlas:

> قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
  
> اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ
  
> لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ
  
> وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ 

**Translation:** Say, &#8220;He is Allah , [who is] One, Allah , the Eternal Refuge [As-Samad], He neither begets (gives birth to) nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.&#8221; [Surah Ikhlas]

The tafseer of this great surah, Surah Ikhlas is very, very extensive; volumes of books have been written on it. One of our writers, Abdul-Ahad, may Allah bless him and increase him in his nearness to Allah, has written very extensively about this surah. Therefore, I will suggest to you some great readings about this great surah, and instead, break down the Arabic grammar word by word.

### Tafseer of Surah Ikhlas

  * [You Are a Witness][1]
  * [Who Can Recite a Third of the Qur&#8217;an Tonight?][2] by Abdul-Ahad
  * [A Command Like No Other: Surah Ikhlas – Pt.1 (Salat 101)][3]
  * [The Ones in Need: Surah Ikhlas – Pt. 2 (Salat 101)][4]
  * [The Unborn: Surah Ikhlas – Pt. 3 (Salat 101)][5]
  * [The Complete: Surah Ikhlas – Pt.4 (Salat 101)][6]
  * [A Due Reward: Surah Ikhlas – Pt.5 (Salat 101)][7]

### Grammatical Analysis

  * **Qul (قُلْ):** Say. It is a command (fi&#8217;l amr), both to the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam), in response to the question of the mushrikeen &#8220;tell us the lineage of your Lord,&#8221; and to us. There are four surahs that begin with qul&#8211;surah Ikhlas, Surah Naas, Surah Falaq, Surah Kafiroon. (We completed tafseer of all these surahs already, walhamdulillah.)
  * **Huwa (هُوَ):** He, or it. One of the most common words you&#8217;ll come across. It&#8217;s technically third-person, singular, and masculine. In this case, it refers to Allah.
  * **Allah (اللَّهُ):** This word is called laf dhuw jalaala (the honorable name) when we refer to it. Because it&#8217;s not proper to say &#8220;Allah is mansoob (having fatha on the last letter)&#8221; or &#8220;Allah is marfoo&#8217; (having damma on the last letter)&#8221; when we speak about grammar.
  * **Ahad (أَحَدٌ):** Ahad means &#8220;one.&#8221; Then again, wahid also means one; the difference is that, if I said I have _wahid_ books, it means I have one book. Or two books. Or more books&#8211;&#8220;I have one book.&#8221; On the other hand, if I said I have _ahad_ books &#8230; that means I have one and _only one_ book. Not two. Not three. Just one. So here, he is Allah, Al-Ahad&#8211;the one, the unique (perhaps unique is a better translation of ahad).
  * **As-Samad (الصَّمَدُ):** This is one of the names of Allah. It means the one who _everybody depends on, but the one who doesn&#8217;t depend on anyone._ Like if there was a fund-raiser and there&#8217;s only one person in the community who has the money, and he pays it&#8211;he can be described as samad. Allah is AS-Samad, THE samad, who we all depend on.
  * **Lam (لَمْ):** Lam is a particle of negation similar to laa or maa or other negations. Lam makes mudaari&#8217; (present/future-tense) verbs majzoom (having sukoon on the last letter).
  * **Yalid (يَلِدْ):** Yalidu is mudaari&#8217; (present/future-tense), singular, and masculine. It&#8217;s from the verb walada, which means to give birth to. It&#8217;s majzoom (yalid and not yalid**u**) because of lam.
  * **Wa (وَ):** Wa by itself, means &#8220;and.&#8221;
  * **Yuwlad (يُولَدْ):** This is the passive form of yalid (evidenced by the damma and fatha on the first and second letters). So &#8220;yalidu&#8221; means &#8220;he gives birth to,&#8221; and yuwladu means &#8220;he was given birth to.&#8221; It&#8217;s also majzoom, with sukoon, because of lam (it&#8217;s connected by the wa, which carries over the grammatical case, too).
  * **Yakun (يَكُن):** Yakunu is the mudaari&#8217; of kaana (he was). It means &#8220;he is.&#8221; Again, it&#8217;s majzoom because of lam.
  * **Lahu (لَّهُ):** Lahu is the preposition &#8220;li&#8221; (for), and hu is the majroor version of huwa. So li + huwa = lahu, roughly translated as &#8220;for him.&#8221;
  * **Kufuwan (كُفُوًا):** If you look in the fiqh books about the chapter of orphan girls, they must be married to someone of the same &#8220;kufwan,&#8221; someone of the same level and status and rank as she is. So here, it&#8217;s saying that there&#8217;s nobody at the same level as Allah&#8211;because he is Al-Ahad.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
