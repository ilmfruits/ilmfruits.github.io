  &#8220;Islamic work isn&#8217;t something we do for a hobby&#8211;it&#8217;s our life.&#8221;
</p>

Work for the cause, don&#8217;t abandon it. Don&#8217;t neglect it to play video games or watch TV or surf the internet. It isn&#8217;t a hobby. It isn&#8217;t part-time. It&#8217;s full-time, all out, no holds-barred work for the cause of Allah.

If you consider the illustrious sahaba, radiallahu &#8216;anhuma ajma&#8217;een, they all gave their all for the cause. Their wealth, their health, their free time, even their very lives.

Why? They understood the contract. Check it out for yourself, in Surah As-Saff, among other places:

<div class="quran">
  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ<br /> تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ<br /> يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَيُدْخِلْكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ وَمَسَاكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِي جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ<br /> وَأُخْرَى تُحِبُّونَهَا نَصْرٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** O you who believe! Shall I lead you to a bargain that will save you from a grievous Penalty? That ye believe in Allah and His Apostle, and that ye strive (your utmost) in the Cause of Allah, with your property and your persons: That will be best for you, if ye but knew! He will forgive you your sins, and admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and to beautiful mansions in Gardens of Eternity: that is indeed the Supreme Achievement. And another (favour will He bestow,) which you love &#8212; help from Allah and a speedy victory. So give the Glad Tidings to the Believers. (Al-Quran, Surah As-Saff, 61:10-13)<sup>1</sup>

So, what are we waiting for? May Allah make us of those who succeed in this transaction, ameen.
