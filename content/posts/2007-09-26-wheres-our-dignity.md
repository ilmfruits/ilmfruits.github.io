excerpt: "Of the beautiful Names of Allah is al-Aziz, the Mighty. Al-Aziz is exalted, perfect in Might, He is the One who grants us victory, and He is the one who hates to have his slaves be humiliated. Dignity, Power, and Glory comes from Allah and Allah alone, and no one can attain this without worshiping Allah. It's time to become a true Abdul-Aziz."

Of the beautiful Names of Allah is al-Aziz, the Mighty. Al-Aziz is exalted, perfect in Might, He is the One who grants us victory, and He is the one who hates to have his slaves be humiliated. Dignity, Power, and Glory comes from Allah and Allah alone, and no one can attain this without worshiping Allah. It&#8217;s time to become a true Abdul-Aziz.
