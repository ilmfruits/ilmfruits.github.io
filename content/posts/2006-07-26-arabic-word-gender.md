  Masculine and Feminine
</div>

In Arabic, all words are one of two genders: masculine, or feminine. There is no &#8220;it&#8221;, no third, gender-neutral gender like English has.

The main thing to remember is that <span class="gem">when you don&#8217;t know the gender, the default is the masculine gender</span>. You also use the masculine gender for mixed groups (eg. if you&#8217;re talking to a group of men and women).

The **main** sign of a word being feminine (remember, if you don&#8217;t know, the default is masculine) is a specific form of the letter ta, called ta-marbuta (التَّأ المَربُوطَة), or &#8220;tied-up ta&#8221;, which looks like this:

<p style="font-size: 400%; font-weight: bold; text-align: center">
  ة
</p>

Ta-marbuta also changes some words from masculine to feminine. For example, the word tabiyb (طَبِيب) means male doctor. Tabiybah (طَبِيبَة) means female doctor (notice the ta-marbuta at the end?).

Some feminine words don&#8217;t have ta-marbuta (like sun (شَمس), so how do you know they&#8217;re feminine? There are only a few words like that, so don&#8217;t worry too much about it.

Wallahu &#8216;alim. Here is a list of some common nouns, both masculine and feminine.

Finally, when refering to nouns, since there&#8217;s no it, you use the masculine pronoun, huwa (هَوِ) for masculine objects, or the feminine pronoun, hiya (هِيِ) for feminine pronouns. So after talking about a duck (بَطَّة) instead of saying &#8220;it is big&#8221; you say (literally) &#8220;she is big&#8221; (هِيِ كَبِيرَةُ) or &#8220;hiya kabiyratun&#8221;.
  
(P.S. if you can&#8217;t read the Arabic easily, increase your font size, or cut-and-paste into Notepad or Office and change the font size to something large, such as 72.)
