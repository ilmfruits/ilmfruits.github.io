Abdullah ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) was a great companion and a great scholar. In fact, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) made du&#8217;a for him, that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grants him knowledge of the deen.

Even more amazing then this, Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) once made du&#8217;a and said, &#8220;O Allah! teach him wisdom (i.e. the understanding of the knowledge of Qur&#8217;an).&#8221; [Bukhari [5/57/100][1]] <span class="gem">This is why his tafseer carries a heavy weight, even today, more then a millenium after his death. This is why, if you ever find tafseer by Abdullah ibn Abbas, seize it and don&#8217;t let go. Ever.<br /> </span>

You can find a lot of points he made in Tafseer ibn Katheer.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grant us better knowledge of Islam and the tawfiq to act upon that knowledge, ameen!
