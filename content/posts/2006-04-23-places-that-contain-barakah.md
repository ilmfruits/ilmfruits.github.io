Continuing our discussion of [barakah][1], you might ask “what places has Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) blessed with barakah?”

To start, **the three blessed massajid:**

  1. **The Ka&#8217;bah:** it is the most blessed place on the Earth, more-so then the surrounding holy sites.
  2. **Medina:** The city is blessed with barakah, and also, <dfn title="the masjid of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)">masjid an-nabawi</dfn> has been blessed with barakah.
  3. **Masjid al-Aqsa:** the masjid, located in Jerusalem, in blessed, as well as the surrounding area of Sham in general.

**How do we know** Allah put **barakah** in these places? Because of the hadith of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) where he said: &#8220;Do not set out on a journey except for three Mosques i.e. Al-Masjid-AI-Haram, Masjid an-Nabawi, and the Masjid of Al-Aqsa.&#8221; [[Bukhari][2]]<sup>1</sup>

In another hadith, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Prayer **in my mosque** [i.e. Masjid an-Nabawi] is **more excellent than a thousand prayers** observed in other mosques, except the Masjid al- Haram.&#8221; [[Muslim][3]]<sup>2</sup>

And there are more ahadith on this topic.

Also, in general, **<dfn title="plural of masjid">massajid</dfn>** are places with barakah. This is because the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;The most **beloved place of any city** are the **massajid**, and the most hated are the marketplaces and shopping centers.&#8221;

There are **extra blessings** to being in these places, so **take advantage** of it inshaAllah. Worship Allah, make dhikr, and engage in **acts of worship**.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) allow us to make the best use of places of barakah, ameen! If you&#8217;re looking to put more barakah in your life, now you know where to hang out!
