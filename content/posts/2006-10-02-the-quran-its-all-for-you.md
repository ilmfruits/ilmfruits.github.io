<p class="gem">
  When you read the Qur&#8217;an, cultivate the mentality that every single surah, verse, ayah, and letter was revealed for you, personally.
</p>

Verse addressed to Banu Israeel (Jews)? Maybe Ahlil Kitaab (people of the book)? Or maybe An-Naas (humankind)? Or even the obvious, to those who believed? Yes, it addresses them&#8211;but it also addresses you. Learn from their past&#8211;their triumphs and their defeats, their actions and their mistakes, their joys and their pains.

And remember, there is nothing uselss in the Qur&#8217;an&#8211;if you don&#8217;t feel like you benefit from any of it, grab a volume of tafseer (maybe Ibn Kathir?) and read up on the meanings.

May Allah cultivate in our hearts a love of this great and fundamental basis of our deen, ameen!
