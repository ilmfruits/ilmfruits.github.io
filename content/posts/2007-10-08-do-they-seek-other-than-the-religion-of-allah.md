    Of the categories of tawheed, the most common one is that of making Allah One and Unique in His Lordship i.e Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah. The meaning of this is believe that only Allah creates, sustains, and nourishes the entire creation. Of the manifestations of this are: 1) every object must have a creator 2) no object can escape that which is decreed 3)  when in distress all of mankind calls out to his Creator. The proofs of this, the proofs of Allah's existence is many fold, of them are: 1) fitrah - innate nature that we are all created with 2) the creation itself - the mountains, the sun, the moon, etc.

Of the categories of tawheed, the most common one is that of making Allah One and Unique in His Lordship i.e Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah. The meaning of this is believe that only Allah creates, sustains, and nourishes the entire creation. Of the manifestations of this are:

  1. every object must have a creator
  2. no object can escape that which is decreed
  3. when in distress all of mankind calls out to his Creator. The proofs of this, the proofs of Allah&#8217;s existence is many fold, of them are: 
      1. fitrah &#8211; innate nature that we are all created with
      2. the creation itself &#8211; the mountains, the sun, the moon, etc.
