My dear brothers and sisters in Islam our beloved Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam has told us:
  
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></p> 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;The angels keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for anyone of you, as long as he is at his mu&#8217;sallah (praying place) and does he does not pass wind. They say, &#8216;O Allah! Forgive him, O Allah! be Merciful to him.&#8221; [Bukhari]
  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    Angels are a great sign of Mercy from Allah and how beautiful it is that Allah has given every single Muslim the ability to feel the mercy just by staying in his place of prayer
  </li>
  <li>
    How great is it that the angels ask Allah for forgiveness for you? Subhanallah&#8230;amazing!
  </li>
  <li>
    Take a moment to relax and feel that blessing and mercy from Allah. Between sunnah and fard&#8230;just sit for a minute or two.
  </li>
  <li>
    How could it be that you will not be more focused in prayer knowing that angels have been asking forgiveness for you?
  </li>
