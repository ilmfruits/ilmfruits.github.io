##### HE IS ALLAH, THE MOST HIGH WHO DOES NOT SLEEP
  
NOR DOES HIS CREATION TAKE PART IN HIS MAJESTY

Continuing in our explanation of the poem and our discussion of the five points relating to tawheed al-asma was-sifat:

##### 4) We do not Ascribe the Qualities of Creation to the Creator

It is not befitting the majesty of Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala that we ascribe to Him characteristics and weaknesses of creation. To Allah belongs the quality of Highness; Highness in His Essence, in His Attributes and esteem, and in His Strength and Power. He is far above His creation and there is no likeness to be made because Allah says:

> _[He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multiplies you thereby. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing [Surah ash-Shura V. 11]_

The Jews and the Christians claim that Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala spent the first six days creating the universe and then slept on the seventh . This claim is absurd and it is not befitting the majesty of Allah because to Him belongs the most beautiful Names and Attributes that are of perfection. Sleep is a weakness that is a characteristic of creation and it is not befitting to ascribe this weakness to the Lord of the heavens and the earth.

Also, the attributes of hearing and seeing are among the human attributes, however when they are ascribed to Allah they are without comparison. Allah hears and sees in a manner that befits His Majesty and we do not compare that to the hearing and seeing of his creation.

##### 5) We do not Ascribe the Qualities of the Creator to His Creation

In the same manner that we do not lower the majesty of Allah by describing Him with qualities of creation, we do not exalt the status of creation by giving them qualities of Allah. By doing so we deify these objects of creation and seek from them that which we should be seeking only from Allah. For example, to turn to an idol or a saint, thinking that they have the ability to grant you what you want, or answer your supplication, or grant you forgiveness is incorrect. It is only Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala who has the ability to answer your supplication, it is only Allah who has the power to grant you what want, and it is only Allah who has the ability to grant you forgiveness. Therefore, no creation can claim to have a share in Allah’s Names and Attributes. If one were to do so then indeed they have committed a crime against Allah, they have ascribed partners to Him, they have made themselves equal to Him, they have gone astray in establishing His rights to be worshipped Alone, and if they die upon it they will be the companions of the eternal Fire.

Also, it is important to note that it is not permissible to give creation the definite forms of Allah’s names unless it is preceded with the prefix ‘abd meaning “slave of”. However, some divine names in their _indefinite_ forms can be used for man because Allah has used them to describe the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam as He says:

> _There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind (ra&#8217;uf) and merciful (raheem) [Surah at-Tawba V. 128]_
