Bismillah walhamdolilah wassalatu wassalam &#8216;ala rasool Allah

Umer radhiAllah anhu used to say:

> _&#8220;If Allah strikes me with calamity I will thank Allah for four things: 1) that the test was not in my deen 2) the calamity could have been worse 3) it is an expiation for my sins 4) any loss after losing the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam is nothing”_

The greatest man that lived after the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq radhiAllah anhu, Umer ibn al-Khattab radhiAllah anhu. What a man! SubhanAllah. We thank Allah for giving us such amazing examples of people to emulate and look up to. Alhamdolilah!

Being thankful to Allah is indeed a great favour granted to the slave from Him. Without His will we would never have the ability to thank Him. On top of that, being thankful to Allah in times of a calamity is a greater favour granted to the slave from Him, subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. Not only has Allah allowed the slave to thank Him for the bounties that are evident, but He has allowed him to look deeper and thank Him for those bounties that arn&#8217;t as evident.

My brothers and sisters, all calamities are indeed a great blessing from Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala because it gives us an opportunity to reflect and understand that everything is in His control. and if He has willed it, then it is always for our betterment. Look to the example of Umer ibn al-Khattab radhiAllah anhu, and let&#8217;s start putting things into correct perspective. Next time we stricken with a calamity&#8211;a lost job, car accident, death in  the family&#8211;go back and thank Allah because atleast you are still Muslim and you still have Jannah waiting for you in the hereafter. Thank Allah, say Alhamdolilah, because we all know things could have always been much worse: if you lost your job, you could have lost your home; if you had a car accident, you could have lost your legs; if you lost a member in the family, you&#8217;ve already lost the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam.  And thank Allah, in abundance, because that little bit of distress and difficulty is an expiation of your sins. Allahuakber!
