Continuing our discussion of [barakah][1], you might ask “what times has Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) blessed with barakah?”

There are six blessed times:

  1. **Ramadan:** The month of Ramadan, in general, is blessed. Also, the night of Laylatul-Qadr is specifically also very blessed. These are ideal times to worship Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), because the reward is greater. The last ten nights of Ramadan are **the most blessed nights of the year**&#8211;more then the days of Dhul Hijjah.
  2. **Ten Days of Dhul Hijjah:** The first ten days of Dhul Hijjah are **the most blessed days of the year**&#8211;more then the days of Ramadan.
  3. **Sacred Months:** These are the months of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah, Dhul Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. Allah has forbidden any kind of agressive hostilities against enemy nations in these months (this applies to Islamic state when it comes into existance inshaAllah). For details, consult tafseer of Surah Tawbah inshaAllah.
  4. **Friday:** Friday, the day of jum&#8217;ah, is also blessed: in one hadith, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: On Friday, Adam (عليه سلام) was created; on Friday, he was expelled from Paradise; on Friday, the trumpet for the day of resurrection will be blown; and on Friday, the people will resurrect. [[Muslim][2]]<sup>1</sup>.
  5. **Last Third of Each Night:** In another hadith, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, descends every night to the heaven of this world when the last third of the night is still to come and says, &#8216;Who will call on Me so that I may answer him? Who will ask Me so that I may give him? Who will ask forgiveness of Me so that I may forgive him?'&#8221; [[Bukhari][3]]<sup>2</sup>
  6. **Early Each Morning:** The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) made du&#8217;a for Allah to bless the early mornings for the Muslim ummah. (You&#8217;ll notice your productivity increases sharply in the morning. Memorizing Qur&#8217;an is also easy in the morning. Subhanallah.)

**Make use of the blessed times**, and perform good deeds in them. And remember, a morning lost is a morning lost (same for a month, or a Friday)&#8211;once that time has gone by, it&#8217;ll _never_ return.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) allow us to make the best use of the blessed times, ameen!
