The majority of utensils and vessels are ok, by consensus--but what about non-Muslims' stuff?  Scholars differed.  (This affects if you can eat at non-Muslim restaurants, too.)"

What utensils and vessels (called _inaa&#8217;_ in Arabic, which includes cups, plates, utensils, and the like&#8211;though we&#8217;ll call it &#8220;utensils&#8221; for simplicity) are halal to eat from? This is important&#8211;your du&#8217;a is at stake! If you eat from haraam, Allah will not accept your du&#8217;a.

**Scholars agree** that all utensils made from pure and clean things&#8211;other then silver and gold, because we&#8217;re prohibited from eating from those&#8211;are pure and clean. So throw out your silverware, even if it&#8217;s only partially silver; gold plating is not allowed, either.)

Is it halal to eat from the cutlery (vessels&#8211;plates, cups, etc.) and utensils of non-Muslims? This issue most impacts Muslims living in non-Muslim localities, such as North America. What&#8217;s the answer? **Scholars disagree** on this. Let&#8217;s look at the opinions.

**Opinion 1:** We can eat from their utensils, because Allah made the food of non-Muslims lawful&#8211;the only things that make their utensils najas is najas stuff.

**Opinion 2:** We can eat from their utensils&#8211;when necessary. Abu Tha&#8217;labah Al-Khushani asked the Prophet, &#8220;we&#8217;re in a land inhabited by People of the Book. Can we eat from their utensils?&#8221; The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat from them, **unless you can&#8217;t find an alternative**, in which case, wash them and eat from them.&#8221;

**Opinion 3:** We can use them if we don&#8217;t see non-Muslims eating pork or driking wine on them. Because in one hadith&#8211;a long hadith&#8211;the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) ran out of wudoo water. He used water from a water-skin of a mushrik and made wudoo with that (as did all his companions&#8211;because of barakah).

So what&#8217;s the conclusion? Allahu &#8216;alim, scholars put forward **opinion three&#8211;you can use their utensils&#8211;so long as they&#8217;re not used for wine or eating najas stuff**&#8211;because of the hadith of the water-skin.

What about **eating at non-Muslim restaurants?** If you go, and they serve alcohol, pork, or najas things, _and_ they cook it on the same skillet/pan/grill/pot/container as your food, then it&#8217;s haraam. But if it&#8217;s, for example, a seafood restaurant, and the majority of their food is ok, then it&#8217;s ok. (But, it&#8217;s preferable to avoid this situation if you can.)

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alim.
