(And it will be said to them): &#8220;Verily, this is a reward for you, and your endeavour has been accepted.&#8221; [Surah Al-Insan, Verse 22]

Not only does Allah reward us by entering us into paradise, but He also says shukran to us.  Allaah using the word shukran towards His slaves!  Subhanallah, that in itself should make a believer super happy.
