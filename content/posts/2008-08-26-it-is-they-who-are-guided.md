Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wasalam &#8216;ala Rasool Allah

Asalamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatahu,

My dear brothers and sisters in this beautiful religion of Islam, sometimes we have to sit back and ponder about life and ponder about the purpose of it. Sometimes we know the purpose, yet we fall of track due to the play and amusement of this world. Nonetheless, we should never despair of the mercy of our Lord, for verily He is the Most Merciful and Most Forgiving.

Patience is a beautiful characteristic and with it comes victory. Some people have very strong levels of patience when it comes to doing what is good for them, but their patience is weak with regards to restraint from harmful things. This is especially true in times we are living in today; we have the utmost patience to strive and to worship Allah however we lack it when it comes to restraining ourselves from our desires. The opposite case is also very true, some people may have strong levels of patience in staying away from evil things but have a weak level of patience when it comes to worshiping Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.

My dear brothers and sisters, it is only beneficial for us to examine ourselves and increase our level of patience in regards to worshiping Allah **and** in staying away from that which is prohibited. What great month to do this in than Ramadan? Lets make the most of it! Only a few days left so lets make the intention now to truly make this Ramadan one of patience in all that is pleasing to Allah.

<span style="color: maroon;"><em>And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.). Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221; They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. blessings, etc.) from their Lord, and receive His Mercy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and it is they who are the guided-ones</span> [Surah Baqarah V.155-157]</em></span>
