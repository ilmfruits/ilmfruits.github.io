&#8220;I have already donated enough to masajids. I want to help the needy, poor, orphans and widows. Its so hard to find these people here in the west. Back home, it was so easy.&#8221; This is the typical problem that many of us face.

So if you are wondering, how and where should I spend my charity, follow these six steps:

  1.  **Niyah Check:**
Make sure that you are only doing it for Allah, not to please anyone else or get praised! Remember &#8220;<a href="htthttp://islambasics.com/view.php?bkID=42&chapter=1" target="_blank">The deeds are considered by the intentions, and a person will get the reward according to his intention</a>&#8221; [Bhukari and Muslim]

  2. **Plan plan and plan:**
You need to plan how much you are going to spend in charity. How frequent would your contributions be? For example you may decide that you will spend 5% of your income every month. Remember the Prophet(صلي الله عليه وسلم) was asked: &#8220;Which deed is most beloved to Allaah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span class="gem">The one that is continuous, even if it is little.</span>&#8221; [Bukhari]

  3. **Where will you spend:**
Write down the categories of organizations that you want to donate to. For example: masajid, educational institutes, orphans, poor and needy etc.

  4. **Plan out the proportion:**
How much are you going to donate for each category. For example, you might decide that I will donate 20% to masajids, 50% to support poor and needy and the rest 30% to support educational institutes.

  5. **Research:**
Its time to research the organizations. To make it easy, I have compiled a [list of various charitable organizations][1]. What&#8217;s great about this website is that you can edit the page and contribute more websites to the list (simply click edit button in bottom right)

  6. **Automatic Payments:**
Look into setting up automatic monthly payments. This way you will not have to worry about donations every now and then. A great way to give Shaytan a black eye!</ol>
