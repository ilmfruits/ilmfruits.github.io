This is the fourth part of our discussion on ways to achieving [purification of our salaah][1].
  
The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said: ‘I have divided the prayer between Myself and My slave, into two halves, and My slave shall have what he has asked for.&#8217;

&#8220;When the slave says &#8220;<dfn title="All praise is for Allah">Ar-Rehman-nir-Raheem</dfn>&#8220;, Allaah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, **&#8220;My slave has extolled me.&#8221;** 

&#8220;When the slave says, &#8220;<dfn title="Master of the Day of Judgement">Malikee Yawma Ddin</dfn>&#8220;, Allaah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, **&#8220;My slave has glorified me&#8221; or &#8220;My servant has related all matters to Me.&#8221;**

&#8220;When the slave says, &#8220;<dfn title="You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help">Iyaka na’ budu wa iyaka nasta’een</dfn>&#8220;, Allaah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, **&#8220;This is between Me and My slave, and My slave shall aqure what he sought.&#8221;**

&#8220;When the slave says, &#8220;<dfn title="Guide us to the Straight Path. the path of those whom You have favoured, not the path of those who receive Your anger, nor of those who go astray">Ihdi naseeratal mustaqeem. Seeratal’ladzina an’amta ‘alayhim ghayril maghdoobi ‘alayhim wa la dawleen</dfn>&#8220;, Allaah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, **&#8220;This is for My slave, and My slave shall have what he asked for.&#8221;**&#8221; (_Saheeh Muslim, Kitaab al-Salaah, Baab wujoob qiraa’at al-Faatihah fi kulli rak’ah_)

Something to definately ponder about … Subhanallah! This is keyyy my brothers and sisters … If you are _aching_ to gain that nearness to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) in salaah, this is your route. Easy access, one-on-one with _Allah_ (سبحانه وتعالى); _Al-Mu’min (THE Giver of Peace), Al-Aziz (THE Almighty), Al-Khaliq (THE Creator)._ What else could one desire?

You want nearness to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)? Here it is. If we all just kept this in our minds while praying—-that we are indeed conversing with _Al-Malik ul-Mulk (THE King of Kings); He_ is responding to our call—-we would definately achieve immense khusoo’. How could it be any other way, when the slave of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) feels his _Rabb_ addressing him and responding to what he is asking for?

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grant us the ability to attain utmost khusoo’ in our salaah.
