**Fard:** technically, it means any action which, if done, deserves reward from Allah; and if neglected, deserves punishment from Allah. (Yes, that&#8217;s right&#8211;you actually _earn reward_ for doing all those fard actions!)

Here, we discuss two classifications of faraaid&#8211;Sofa Fard, and Bucket-Seat Fard.

Sofa Fard (also known as Fard Muwassa&#8217;) is a fard which you **have a choice of when you can do it**. It&#8217;s like a sofa&#8211;you can sit on the left, on the right, in the middle, anywhere you want!

Praying Dhur is a sofa fard&#8211;you can pray at the start time, half an hour before the end time, at some point in the middle, etc. anytime before &#8216;Asr. (Another definition of sofa fard is: an action you have time to do, and have time to do another similar action.)

Some examples of sofa fards include:

  * Praying any of the 5x daily prayers
  * Giving Zakaat-ul-Badl to poor people in Ramadan before &#8216;Eid
  * Performing Hajj

Bucket-Seat Fard (also known as Fard Mudayyaq) is an action where **you don&#8217;t have a choice of when you can do it**. It&#8217;s like a bucket&#8211;if you need to sit in the bucket (camping, anyone?) then _you have to sit in the bucket_. You can&#8217;t choose where&#8211;you only fit in one spot.

The fasts of Ramadan are bucket-seat fards&#8211;you have to do them IN Ramadan, you can&#8217;t do them before or after (unless you missed them legitimately).

Some examples of bucket-seat fards include:

  * Fasting in Ramadan
  * Paying zakaah one year after you cross the nisaab
  * Visiting Arafah in Hajj on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah

What other examples of sofa and bucket-seat fards can you think of?
