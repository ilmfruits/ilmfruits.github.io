In one of the battles in the time of the Khulafa Rashideen, the Muslim armies attacked a fort behind a trench.

With a trench, defenses spread thin: 500 people need to guard all points of the trench. So in any given area, you have only a few guards.

How did the Muslims succeed? They find the _one_ lazy guy&#8211;if the trench is eight feet deep and six feet across, they find the location two feet deep and one foot across&#8211;and focus the entire army towards that one location, all the hundreds or thousands of <span class="foreignWord">mujahideen</span>.

Three men cannot stand up to that kind of onslaught.

The &#8220;cut-throat corporate world&#8221; employs this technique as well. Learn from it. Benefit from it.
