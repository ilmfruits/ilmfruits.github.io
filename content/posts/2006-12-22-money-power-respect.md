**How do we attain money, power, and respect?**

The path is easy, you follow the way of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) and the commands of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), then inshallah you will attain the money, the power, and the respect. Now it is up to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) whether He blesses you with such things. However, with sincerity in your actions, the chances are high.

The overlying goal is to keep Islam in your heart; thrive for it, live to please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), do all your actions in accordance to the sunnah, and follow the commands of The Al-Mighty, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Do not keep these dreams and aspirations in your heart, because surely this is a disease and a footstep towards Shaytan. You may get the wealth and maybe even the power, but the true respect will be lacking, as only Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has the ability to grant someone with respect.

<p class="gem">
  Live in this life with the Duniya in your hands and Islam in your hearts.

Let&#8217;s look at our examples, let&#8217;s look at people such as Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (رضي الله عنه), Umar Ibn al-Khattab(رضي الله عنه), Uthman bin Affan (رضي الله عنه), Ali (رضي الله عنه): These people kept the duniya in their hands, and surely kept Islam in their hearts. It was these people who strived to do all they could _fi sabillillah_ (for the sake of Allah), and they definately got their reward, they definately got that respect. Look at how Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) raised to status of the beloved khulafa, alhamdolilah! To this date, and to the end of time, these people will be looked at with great dignity, with great honour, with much love by the ummah and only because they sought respect from Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and no one else.

Know, that if you seek respect, it will only come from Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). How many before us have come and gone, but how many of them have truly been dignified and respected to the point that they are still remembered with high rankings?
