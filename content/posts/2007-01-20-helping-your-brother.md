excerpt: "How many times has a fellow Muslim asked you for help? And how many times have you helped him, by fulfilling his needs? Well, did you know for everytime you help your brother or sister in Islaam from a difficulty, Allah Almighty will remove one of your troubles on the Day of Resurrection! SO -- don't think twice, next time your fellow Muslim asks you to help him out!"

Ibn \`Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sa) said:

<p class="stylish">
  “A Muslim is a brother of (another) Muslim, he neither wrongs him nor does hand him over to one who does him wrong. If anyone fulfils his brother&#8217;s needs, Allah will fulfil his needs; if one relieves a Muslim of his troubles, Allah will relieve his troubles on the Day of Resurrection…&#8221; [Bukhari and Muslim].
</p>

<dfn title="Glory Be To Allah">Subhanallah!</dfn> &#8212; look at the reward for helping out your fellow Muslim, to simply help them and to assist them in their needs, you will get the help and assistance of Allah Almighty.

**_What else can we ask for?!_**

But not only will Allah fulfil us in our needs in this world, but by you also helping your Muslim brother or sister out in times of hardships and difficulties &#8212; Allah will help us in the most difficult time in our life, being the Day Of Judgement, when we will all be in such a frantic, in need of help, and Allah promises us in this Hadith that He will relieve us our troubles on that day if we simply relieve the troubles of a Muslim in this world.

**_Allahu Akbar! So what are you waiting for? Get Busy!!_**

In another Hadith, Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sa) said:

<p class="stylish">
  &#8220;He who removes from a believer one of his difficulties of this world, Allah will remove one of his troubles on the Day of Resurrection; and he who finds relief for a hard-pressed person, Allah will make things easy for him on the Day of Resurrection; he who covers up (the faults and sins) of a Muslim, Allah will cover up (his faults and sins) in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah supports His slave as long as the slave is supportive of his brother…” [Muslim]
</p>

So strive hard to lend a hand to your Muslims in need, no matter how big or small their need may be &#8212; help them for the sake of Allah and not for any worldly matter (otherwise your actions will be fruitless). Be there for them in times of calamity and be assured that Allah will remove from you your difficulties, and not only that &#8230; Allah will cover up your faults and sins in this world **and** the Hereafter because you simply covered up the faults and sins of your brother.

So next time if a situation arises for you to help your fellow Muslim out, don’t hesitate whether to do it or not, don’t think or have the attitude _‘What will I get out of it?’_ &#8212; just rememeber the words of Your Prophet Muhammad (sa), when he said:

<p class="stylish">
  “Allah supports His slave as long as the slave is supportive of his brother…”
</p>

So, never leave your brother standing after asking for your help, if he is in need of your help… help him <dfn title="For The Sake of Allah">fesabeelillah</dfn>&#8230;

For it is **YOUR DUTY** to do so &#8212; 

and it is a **RIGHT** he has over you.
