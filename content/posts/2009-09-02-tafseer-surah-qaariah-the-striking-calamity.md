This is post #30 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).

Allah says, in Surah Qaari&#8217;ah:

> الْقَارِعَةُ
  
> مَا الْقَارِعَةُ
  
> وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْقَارِعَةُ 

**Translation:** The Striking Calamity &#8211; What is the Striking Calamity? And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity? [Surah Qaariah, verses 1-3]

As we mentioned, the phrase in verse three&#8211;&#8220;wa maa adaraaka maa &#8230;,&#8221; is a phrase that means that, you cannot understand this thing&#8211;Al-Qaari&#8217;ah, the striking calamity. And you will _never_ understand Al-Qaari&#8217;ah.

But, Allah (azza wa jal) always gives us just a little glimpse of what this thing is that He says we will never be able to fully understand:

> يَوْمَ يَكُونُ النَّاسُ كَالْفَرَاشِ الْمَبْثُوثِ

**Translation:** It is the Day when people will be like moths, dispersed, [Surah Al-Qaariah, verse 4]

Have you ever seen moths flying into a campfire? How they all jumble together and bump into each other as they attempt to fly into it?

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/campfire.jpg" alt="like moths to a flame ..." title="like moths to a flame ..." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1376" />

_That_ is how the human being will be on that day.

> وَتَكُونُ الْجِبَالُ كَالْعِهْنِ الْمَنفُوشِ 

**Translation:** And the mountains will be like wool, fluffed up. [Surah Qari&#8217;ah, verse 5]

See those big, strong mountains in National Geographic? Tough. Unmovable. On that day, they will be like carded wool.

_Obliterated._ Not just broken into pieces; but utterly obliterated. What will be the state of the human being on a day that _mountains will be obliterated?_ Subhanallah, _this_ is Al-Qaari&#8217;ah.

But there&#8217;s hope! Allah says:

> فَأَمَّا مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ
  
> فَهُوَ فِي عِيشَةٍ رَّاضِيَةٍ 

**Translation:** Then as for one whose scales are heavy [with good deeds], He will be in a pleasant life. [Surah Qaari&#8217;ah, verses 6-7].

Allah says _heavy_. The one who&#8217;s deeds are _heavy_. Is it easy carrying something heavy, like an elephant? No way! Similarly, to qualify for heavy deeds, it&#8217;s hard work! And the work starts now, _today_.

Now think about this. You&#8217;re standing there, watching the sun wrapped up, and the stars fading, and the mountains blown away, and the beasts running wild &#8230; 

Where do kids go when they&#8217;re scared? To their parents; or to their mother. It&#8217;s almost as if the person who did sins and evil deeds, would run to their mother.

But Allah says:

> وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ
  
> فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ 

**Translation:** But as for one whose scales are light, His refuge will be _Haawiyah_. [Surah Qariah, verses 8-9]

Literally, if you read the Arabic, it says &#8220;fa ummuhu haawiyah,&#8221; his mother will be Haawiyah.

Who is haawiyah?

> وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا هِيَهْ
  
> نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ 

**Translation:** And what can make you know what that is? (Meaning, we will never know what it is; but here&#8217;s a glimpse:) It is a Fire, intensely hot. [Surah Qaari&#8217;ah, verses 10-11]

His mother will be _blazing-hot fire._ Subhanallah.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala a&#8217;lam.

**Action Items:**

  * **Contemplate Al-Qaari&#8217;ah.** This great day is something that would make the companions&#8211;some of them, like &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab or &#8216;Al ibn Abi Talib (radiallahu &#8216;anhumaa), grown men, brave beyond anything today, courageous, strong, fighting men&#8211;weep in their salah. That is something to think about.
  * **Reflect on Al-Qaari&#8217;ah.** What is it about this day that really hits you in the heart and makes you think/weep? Comment and share it insha&#8217;Allah.
