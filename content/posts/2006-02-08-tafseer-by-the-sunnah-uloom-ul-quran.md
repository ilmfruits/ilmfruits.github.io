Tafseer by the Sunnah of the Prophet of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, has multiple purposes.

  1. **Explains:** It explains vague commands such as Hajj, and clarifies details. It also explains unclear concepts, such as the &#8220;white thread of dawn [seperated from] the black thread of night&#8221;.
  2. **Connotations:** Example forthcoming inshaAllah.
  3. **Clarifies:** With commands like &#8220;amputate the hand of the theif&#8221;, it clarifies (they must steal something worth 25 dinar or more, the item must be properly guarded, it cannot be food, etc.)
  4. **Intent of Verses:** Tafseer by the Sunnah reveals the intent behind verses, such as the last two verses of Surah Fatiha: &#8220;not of those who earned your anger, nor of those who went astray&#8221; &#8212; the Jews earned the anger of Allah, and the Christians went astray. May Allah guide them.
  5. **Abbrogation Explaination:** Tafseer by the Sunnah sorts out the order of abbrogation. For example, alcohol was mentioned multiple times in the Qur&#8217;an&#8211;as something with good and evil in it (and more evil then good), as something outlawed, and so on.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
