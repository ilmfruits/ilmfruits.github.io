Continuing our study of the fruits of <dfn title="faith">eman</dfn>, here are some additional fruits that spring from the tree of eman:

<div class="miniTitle">
  16) Brotherhood
</div>

In Surah Hujraat, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** The Believers are but a single Brotherhood &#8230; (Surah Hujraat, verse 10)<sup>1</sup>

If you&#8217;ve ever been to a different city, you walk into the grocery store, and nobody says anything. People just buy their own stuff and ignore you. Probably the most you&#8217;ll get out of the cashier when you check out is a &#8220;hi&#8221;.

But if you go to the masjid&#8211;even if you&#8217;ve never been there before and don&#8217;t know anybody&#8211;it feels like you&#8217;re at home. You talk to complete strangers as if you&#8217;ve known them for a long time. There&#8217;s a sense of mutual trust, based only on the fact that you&#8217;re all Muslim.

And this is from the blessings of the <dfn title="Muslim community">ummah</dfn>. <span class="gem">The <strong>entire ummah</strong> is united by bonds of eman.</span> Subhanallah.
