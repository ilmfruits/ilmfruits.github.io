The following is an explaination on zakaah as it applies to business. In short, it&#8217;s 2.5% of marketable items.

Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub: The Mesenger of Allah used to order us to pay the sadaqah (zakaah) on what (goods) we prepared for trade. [Abu Dawud [9/1557][1]]<sup>1</sup>

&#8220;Goods from what we prepared for trade&#8221; means business inventory. So if someone owns a clothing store full of leather jackets, they pay zakaah on all the jackets not sold after a year.

Which begs the question&#8211;what is business? Here, we define business as **&#8220;an exchange of value with the intention of profit&#8221;**. That&#8217;s what business is.

So if someone&#8217;s rich uncle dies (inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon), then those 500 leather jackets he passes on is not zakaahable. They don&#8217;t have to pay zakaah on that, until the day they decide &#8220;hey, let&#8217;s sell this stuff off!&#8221;

In Surah Baqarah, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ <strong>أَنفِقُواْ</strong> مِن طَيِّبَاتِ <strong>مَا كَسَبْتُمْ</strong> وَمِمَّا أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم <strong>مِّنَ الأَرْض</strong>
</div>

**Translation:** O you who believe! Give of the good things which you have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you &#8230; [[Surah Baqarah][2], verse 267]<sup>2</sup>

Keywords here are &#8220;anfiquw&#8221; (give) and &#8220;maa kasabtu&#8221; (what you earned) and what comes out of the land. &#8220;What you earned&#8221; means from your business, and &#8220;what comes out of the land&#8221; means crops&#8211;for farmers. So this verse covers both produce (rice, wheat, etc.) and business transactions.

There are two conditions on business items before they are zakaahable:

  1.  **Ownership through an exchange contract:** the items must be owned through an exchange contract. This excludes things like getting items through inheritance, and things like gifts (unilateral contracts). One reason we didn&#8217;t say &#8220;owned through buying and selling&#8221;, is because it can be an exchange&#8211;&#8220;my taxi driver will work 12 hours for you, and you&#8217;ll give us 200 pizzas.&#8221;
  2. **Intention to sell:** You might have a whole lot of products&#8211;maybe you bought an entire box of awesome &#8216;itters (perfumes) that you could technically sell, but instead, give them away as gifts. In that case, you don&#8217;t pay zakaah on those items&#8211;even if you keep them for a long time!

When paying zakaah, the amount paid (2.5%) is calculated _not on the price the items were purchased for_, but on the _current average market price_. Those 500 leather jackets moldering in a warehouse since last year? You pay zakaah on the **current** market price for them.

One final point: zakaah on cattle is paid in cattle. Zakaah on food is paid in food. What about business zakaah? The answer is, it&#8217;s paid **in gold and silver** (or in cash). You can&#8217;t give 2.5% of your leather jackets as sadaqah!

(While you&#8217;re calculting your business zakaah on your **marketable commodities** like leather jackets, don&#8217;t forget to include zakaah on **liquid cash** you may have lying around, as well as **reclaimable debts** you expect will be paid back (including money you&#8217;ve made that hasn&#8217;t reached you yet), and subtract **mature debts** of a year or more&#8211;it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t own that money.)

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alim. Just a reminder inshaAllah that this covers zakaah from a Shafi&#8217;ee madhab position. May Allah increase us in our knowledge and understanding of the pillars of Islam, ameen!
