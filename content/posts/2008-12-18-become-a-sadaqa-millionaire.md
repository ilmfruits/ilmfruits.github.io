excerpt: "Can you become a sadaqa millionaire? Sure, if you had a million dollars; but what if you don't? In fact, some companions complained to the Prophet that they couldn't donate as much as other, richer companions. So the Prophet taught them how they can become, literally, sadaqa millionaires--without spending a single dollar! How did they do it?"

How would you like to give sadaqa? You might say &#8220;sure, _I&#8217;d_ like to do it&#8211;but I have no money!&#8221; What if I told you there&#8217;s a way to give sadaqa that _doesn&#8217;t_ require money? That, in fact, you could even out-class the rich people in their sadaqa! All it takes is a little time and effort!

Would you be interested?

One of the things the companions used to do is compete with each other in good deeds. Even if they were doing more good deeds than the majority of companions, if there were a few people (or even one person) doing more than them, they would strive to beat that person in good deeds. (And among other things, they used to ask frequently: Which is the MOST beloved deed to Allah?)

You bet _they&#8217;d_ be interested.

Recorded below is one such hadith, where the poor people complained to the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Complained that they were poor? No! Complained they didn&#8217;t have a BMW, a five-story house? No! Complained that <span class="gem">they couldn&#8217;t donate as much for the sake of Allah as the rich people!</span> Subhanallah! (That&#8217;s one of the qualities that made them _so much more_ better than us.)

And that&#8217;s precisely what we&#8217;re discussing!

> Abu Hurairah narrated that Abu Dharr said to the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;The wealthy people have all the rewards; they pray as we pray; they fast as we fast; and they have surplus wealth which they give in charity; but we have no wealth which we may give in charity.&#8221; Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Abu Dharr, should I not teach you phrases by which you acquire the rank of those who excel you? No one can acquire your rank except one who acts like you. [&#8230;] Say _Allahu Akbar_ thirty-three times; and say _Alhamdulillah_ (Praise be to Allah) thirty-three times; and say _SubhanAllah_ (Glory be to Allah) thirty-three times; and end it by saying, _Laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu yuhyi wa yomeetu wa Huwa ‘ala kulli shayin Qadeer._ (There is no god but Allah alone, He has no partner, to Him belongs the Kingdom, to Him praise is due and He has power over everything.) Your sins will be forgiven, even if they are like the foam of the sea.&#8221; [Recorded in Abu Dawud, #1499] 

That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s **that** easy! Give your excuses a black eye, and start donating. In fact, people in our communities today don&#8217;t do this; so you can beat them all, in the sight of Allah&#8211;all of them. By applying this hadith consistently.

And after this hadith was narrated, the rich people mentioned in it ALSO heard this hadith. And THEY started doing this too! Subhanallah, _that&#8217;s_ stiff competition! So the poor people came back and complained _again_ to the Prophet; and he said: &#8220;Haadhaa fadlullahi, yu&#8217;tiyhu man yashaa.&#8221; (This is the bounty of Allah, He gives to whom He wishes.)

And the Messenger of Allah told us that sadaqa does not decrease wealth. So you can bet you&#8217;ll get this back&#8211;every bit of it.

So what are you waiting for?

**Action Items:**

  * **Pick a Time to do Dhikr.** If you do it consistently, you will be successful, insha&#8217;Allah. Pick a time like: walking to your car; before you reach the highway; on the bus; while standing in line for food; after salaah; WHATEVER time works for you&#8211;just pick a time, and be consistent in it. Day after day, month after month, you&#8217;ll rack up the ajr.
  * **Tell three people this hadith.** For every subhanallah and alhamdulillah and allahu akbar they say, _you_ get a copy of the reward too!
  * **Make Du&#8217;a.** Ask Allah, Ar-Razzaq, Al-Ghani, to make you rich if it is better for you, and to remove any stinginess from your heart, and to make you amongst the sincere ones.
  * **Donate Your Dollars!** If you _are_ amongst those blessed with _some_ level of wealth, realize that you can be amongst those with the **highest reward** if you spend it for the sake of Allah. So spend it! Even if you&#8217;re not rich, spend a small portion of what you have.
