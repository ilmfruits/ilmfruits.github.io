**Absolute/Qualified meaning vs unqualified meaning:**

This occurs when a word is used in its absolute/unqualified meaning in one context, and then used in qualified sense in another place. An example of this would be the ruling on the area of the arms to be wiped in tayammum. In Surah al-Maidah <a href="http://quran.com/5/6" target="_blank">5:6</a>, Allah instructs us about ablution &#8220;wash your faces and your hands [_aydikum_] upto the elbows&#8221;. Here washing of the hands has been qualified with the phrase &#8220;upto the elbows&#8221;. However, in the same verse, for tayammum, the instructions are &#8220;_take clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it_&#8221; . Here the word &#8220;_aydikum_&#8221; (hands) occurs in unqualified way. Hence, some scholars ruled that for tayammum, hands are to be wiped upto the elbows as the second occurrence of hand is qualified by the first. However, the Hanafis argue that the hukum in regard to tayammum is conveyed in absolute terms and hence shouldn&#8217;t be qualified.
