In Surah Lahab, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَامْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ<br /> فِي جِيدِهَا <strong>حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ</strong>
</div>

**Translation:** And his wife, the wood-carrier. Upon her neck is a twisted rope of Masad (palm fibre).

Abu Lahab and his wife were some of the most severe opponents to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). They fully understood his message and recognized him as a Prophet, and still they opposed him, until the end of their days.

The wife of Abu Lahab used to go out of her way to harm the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم). For example, she would place thorns on the path he would take. After this surah was revealed, she was so furious, she picked up a big rock and set out to brain the Messenger of Allah. But Allah protected him.

That was the mentality they had, these opponents of the da&#8217;wa.

So you might ask, _what&#8217;s the deal with this necklace of palm-fibre?_

The answer is, Abu Lahab&#8217;s wife used to own like a gold necklace. You know how at fundraisers, people give their gold, their jewelry, for the masjid or the cause? Well, _she_ sold her necklace to _oppose_ Islam, and in the akhira, <span class="gem">Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) replaced it with a necklace of fire</span>. 

And we learn from this that, for the person who gives in the way of opposing Islam, Allah rewards them with a painful reward. So **for sure** Allah will reward those who give in the way of Islam.
