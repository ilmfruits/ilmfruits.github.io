The following is an excerpt from &#8220;Don&#8217;t be Sad&#8221; by Shaykh Aaidh ibn Abdullah Al-Qarni.

  Extract the Honey, but do not break the Hive

Everything that has gentleness within it is beautified, and whatever lacks it is spoiled. When you meet someone, giving them a bright smile and a kind word, you are displaying a characteristic of the truly successful person, a characteristic that even a bee exhibits. When a bee lands on a flower (doing so for a practical purpose) it does not destroy it, because Allah rewards gentleness with that which He does give for harshness. There are certain people whose personalities are like magnets , attracting everyone who is nearby, simply because they are loved for their gentle talk, their good manners, and their noble deeds.

Winning the friendship of others is an art that is mastered by those that are noble and pious; a circle of people constantly surrounds them. Their mere presence in a gathering is a blessing, and when they are absent they are missed and asked about.

These blessed people have a code of conduct entitled: &#8220;Repel (the evil) with one which is better (ie. Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily! He, between whom and you there was enmity(will become) as though he was a close friend.&#8221; [Surah Fussilat, 41:34]

They suck out malice from others with sincerity, forgiveness, and gentleness. They forget evil that was enacted upon them and preserve the memory of kindness received. Biting, harsh words may be aimed at them, but such words pass by their ears without entering and continue on their path without ever returning. They are in a state of calmness. People in general, and Muslims in particular, are safe from suffering any harm at their hands.

The Prophet Muhammad(blessings and peace be upon him) said: &#8220;The Muslim is the person whose tongue and hand do not harm others. And the Believer is he, whom others trust, about their blood and wealth.&#8221;

He further said: &#8220;Verily Allah ordered me to keep relations with those that cut me off, to forgive the one who does injustice with me, and to give to those who withhold from me.&#8221;

The noble Qur&#8217;an put it: &#8220;Those who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily, Allah loves the good-doers.&#8221; [Surah Al-Imran, 3:134]

Give to such people glad tidings of a reward close at hand in terms of peace and tranquility. Also, give glad tidings to them a reward in the Hereafter, of gardens and rivers, wherein they will be in close proximity to their forgiving Creator. &#8220;In a seat of truth (Paradise), reclining upon the couches lined with silk brocade, and the fruits of the two Gardens will be near at hand..&#8221; [Surah Ar-Rahman, 55:55]
