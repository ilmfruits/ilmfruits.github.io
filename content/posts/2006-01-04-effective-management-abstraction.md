**Abstraction:** Selective ignorance of certain elements in order to focus on other elements.

In software development, abstraction means you zoom out and see the big picture. You ignore minor implementation details&#8211;what are the little pieces? How do they work?&#8211;and focus on the whole. These are the systems and how they fit together, and this is the overall goal.

_When you employ abstraction, efficiency increases._ No longer bogged down with function pointers, memory management, or 16-bit register values, you focus on how to make your software work better.

Similarly, when you&#8217;re in the upper echelons of an Islamic organization or project, employ abstraction. _Ignore the little details to improve your efficiency._ This doesn&#8217;t mean you neglect them&#8211;someone handles them. But focus on the big picture&#8211;**don&#8217;t do everything**.

For example, if you&#8217;re planning an event, don&#8217;t be the person at the door taking coats, and the person at the registration table, and the person who books the speaker and location, and the person who advertises, _and_ the person who manages food preperation. Focus on the **overall event**&#8211;this is the overall theme, we want one of these speakers and a location in this city. The rest is, as they say, implementation specific.

And this way, you can focus on long-term and overall goals of any event, as well as planning and management of multiple events, instead of being a superstar for one event.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
