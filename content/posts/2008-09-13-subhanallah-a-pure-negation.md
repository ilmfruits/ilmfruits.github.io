<span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah walhamdolilah was-salatu was-salam &#8216;ala Rasool Allah sallalahu alayhi wasalam</span>

Continuing in our discussion of the oft-repeated words and phrases in our salat, this week inshallah we will focus on looking at: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">SubhanAllah</span></span>

This is another word that is very common in the Muslim&#8217;s vocabulary. We all have heard the word, we all say it in our prayers daily (inshallah), yet how many of us truly understand its meaning?

Commonly this word is translated as, <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Glory be to Allah&#8221;</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;All Glory is to Allah&#8221;</span>. I&#8217;m not going to say these definitions are wrong but I do think there is a lot depth associated with saying <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #660000;">SubhanAllah</span> which is not captured in the above translations. A better translation or meaning of the word would be, <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;far above is Allah from that which they associate to Him&#8221;</span>

> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 180%; color: black;">وَإِذْ قَالَ لُقْمَانُ لِابْنِهِ وَهُوَ يَعِظُهُ يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span>
  
> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: black;">And (remember) when Luqman said unto his son, when he was exhorting him: O my dear son! Ascribe no partners unto Allah. Lo! to ascribe partners (unto Him) is a tremendous wrong </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: black;">[31:13]</span>

And so the greatest transgression, the great act of disbelief, the greatest act of disrespect, the greatest of all sins, the most disgusting of all acts one could do is to associate partners with Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.

And so saying <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #660000;">SubhanAllah </span>implies the following:

  * All Glory is due to Allah
  * Allah is the One who is far above the partners people associate with Him
  * This phrase is a negation of shirk (associating partners with Allah; to learn more click [here][1])
  * It encompasses the greatest act of goodness (negating any partners to Allah)
  * The negation of shirk leads you to affirm His Oneness (tawheed; to learn more click [here][2])
  * Forgiveness for our sins

<strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></strong>

<blockquote style="color: black;">
  <p>
    <strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Allah said: &#8220;&#8230;O son of Adam! If you bring forth the earth full of errors, then you meet Me while you do not associate anything (or anyone) with Me, I will bring forth for you its full of forgiveness.&#8221; </strong><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">[At-Tirmidhee (Shaikh Albanee rendered it as Hasan)]</span></strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>

> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: black;">Allah’s Apostle sallalahu alayhi wasalam said, “Whoever says, ‘Subhan Allah wa bihamdihi,’ one hundred times a day, will be forgiven all his sins even if they were as much as the foam of the sea.&#8221; </span>**<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: black;">[Sahih Bukhari]</span></span>**

How is it that just by saying a simple phrase like <dfn style="font-weight: bold; color: #660000;" title="I deem Allah free of any resemblance to anything whatsoever in any respect, and I celebrate His Praises">SubhanAllahi wa bihamdi</dfn> we can have all our sins forgiven? Because in it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">negation of shirk</span> (the worst of all acts), which leads to the affirmation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">pure tawheed</span> (the greatest of all acts). <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br /> </span>
  
My dearest brothers and sisters, next time you&#8217;re in sajood and you say <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #660000;">Subhana Rabbi al-&#8216;ala</span> </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #660000;">Subhana Rabbi al-adzeem</span></span> let yourself ponder about its meanings&#8230;let yourself taste the sweetness of salat by pondering over that which you say and recite.

May Allah make us amongst those who establish our prayers with full submissiveness and concentration.
