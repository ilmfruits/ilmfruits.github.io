Bismillah

What is the greatest gift you could ever receive? That you could ever want? That would bring you the greatest happiness and delight?&#8230;..Think about it.

Got an idea? &#8230;.good.

Most of us will be thinking of Jannah and all of its delights. But the most pleasurable thing in Jannah is not having spouses, or servants that will serve you, or drinking milk and honey. No rather, there is something MUCH GREATER for the Dwellers of Jannah that Allah ta&#8217;ala is keeping for them&#8230;
  
<span style="font-family: garamond,serif;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: medium;">حدثنا ‏ ‏عبيد الله بن ميسرة ‏ ‏قال حدثني ‏ ‏عبد الرحمن بن مهدي ‏ ‏حدثنا ‏ ‏حماد بن سلمة ‏ ‏عن ‏ ‏ثابت البناني ‏ ‏عن ‏ ‏عبد الرحمن بن أبي ليلى ‏ ‏عن ‏ ‏صهيب ‏<br /> ‏عن النبي ‏ ‏صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ ‏قال ‏ ‏إذا دخل أهل الجنة الجنة قال يقول الله تبارك وتعالى تريدون شيئا أزيدكم فيقولون ألم تبيض وجوهنا ألم </span> <span style="font-size: medium;">تدخلنا الجنة وتنجنا من النار قال فيكشف الحجاب فما أعطوا شيئا أحب إليهم من النظر إلى ربهم عز وجل ‏</span>
  
The most pleasurable thing to the Dwellers of Jannah:
  
_When those deserving of Paradise would enter Paradise, the Blessed and the Exalted would ask: Do you wish Me to give you anything more? They would say: Hast Thou not brightened our faces? Hast Thou not made us enter Paradise and saved us from Fire? He (the narrator) said: He (God) would lift the veil, **and of things given to them nothing would he dearer to them than the sight of their Lord, the Mighty and the Glorious**._ Muslim.

So which duaa should we make to receive this pleasure? Our Messenger alayhi salaatu wa salaam teaches us:
  
<span style="font-size: x-large;">اللهم اني اسالك </span><span style="font-size: x-large;">لذة النظر الى وجهك و الشوق الى لقائك</span>
  
Allahumma innee asaluka lathatan-nadhari ilaa wajhika was-shawqa ilaa liqaa&#8217;ik
  
I ask You for the delight of gazing at Your Countenance and the eagerness of meeting You. (Narrated in Nisaa&#8217;i)

Remember: &#8220;The supplication of every one of you **will be granted** if he does not get impatient&#8221; (Bukhari and Muslim) So make this duaa in this blessed month with full conviction, full hope that Allah will answer your duaa. Allah is near to His slaves, call upon Him Alone, He is Samee&#8217;un wa Mujeebu Ad-Da&#8217;waat. (The Hearer and Responder to Prayers). Do not be hesitant in your duaas, ask Allah for the BEST.

May Allah ta&#8217;ala bless us with the delight of gazing upon Him, make our best deeds our last, and make the best day of ours the day that we meet Him ta&#8217;ala. Ameen.
