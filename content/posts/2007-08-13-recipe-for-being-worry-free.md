<div class="quran">
  بَلَى مَنْ <strong>أَسْلَمَ</strong> وَجْهَهُ لِلّهِ وَهُوَ <strong>مُحْسِنٌ</strong> فَلَهُ <strong>أَجْرُهُ</strong> عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَ<strong>لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong>
</div>

**Translation:** Nay, but whoever **submits** his face (himself) to Allah and he is a **Muhsin** then his **reward** is with his Lord (Allah), on such shall be **no fear**, **nor shall they grieve**. [Suratul Baqarah, verse 112]

_1. Submit to Allah = fulfill the faraidh and abandon the haram_

_2. Be a Muhsin = do ibadah as if you see Allah, treat parents outstandingly, fulfill the rights of others outstandingly…basically, do good at every opportunity and whatever you do, **try** to be outstanding in it._ 

_1 + 2 = Reward is with Allah **AND** no worries in life (no fear nor any grief).</p> 

Why? Because you KNOW you did your best in the most outstanding way (ihsan, point 2), and you KNOW you are doing it for Allah (submission, point 1). So, no worries!</em>
