We praise someone under two circumstances: for the excellent attributes they possess, or for the deeds they perform towards us, such that we feel gratitude towards them. [1]

The only one who deserves praise in **all** these levels is the Creator of excellence, the Perfect Being who showers us with abundant favors again and again!

<div class="quran">
  <strong>الْحَمْدُ للّهِ</strong> رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds. [Surah Al-Fatiha, verse 2]

How true are the words of the righteous man who said, &#8220;How can I truly thank Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), when my desire to thank him is a blessing _by_ Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and deserves to be thanked for!&#8221;

Subhan&#8217;Allah, lets reflect upon this heart-felt expression whenever we say it. Let us fill our scales of good deeds with the phrase, &#8220;Alhamdulillah&#8221;. [2]

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) help us learn how to praise Him in the best manner, such that we _mean_ it, and don&#8217;t just _say_ it, ameen!

_Tip:_ One way to get the maximal benefit from the verbalization of _alhamdulillah_ is to actively think of a blessing Allah blessed us with when we say it. [3] And there are always _tons_ of blessings to remember, for Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن <strong>تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا</strong>
</div>

**Translation:** And He gives you of all that you ask for. But if you _count the favours of Allah,_ you will _never be able_ to number them! [Surah Ibrahim, verse 34]

  [2] On the authority of Abu Maalik al-Haarith ibn Aasim al-Ashari(رضي الله عنه), who said: The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;Purification is half of the faith. <em>The phrase <strong>al-hamdulilaah</strong> (&#8216;All praise be to Allah&#8217;) fills the scale</em>. The phrases subhan&#8217;Allah (&#8216;High is Allah above every imperfection and need; He is pure and perfect&#8217;) and al-hamdulillah (&#8216;All prase be to Allah&#8217;) together fill&#8211;or each fill&#8211; what is between the heavens and the earth. Prayer is a light. Charity is a proof. Patience is a brightness. The Quran is either an argument for or against you. And everyone goes out in the morning and sells himself, either freeing or destroying himself.&#8221; [Muslim]
