**Zaid:** As-Salamu &#8216;Alykum
  
**Abdur-Rahmaan:** Wa-Alykum As-salam&#8230;..how was your volunteer experience at the seminar?

**Zaid:** Alhumdullilah. But&#8230;. I worked so hard for this event but no one came to me and said any thanks or any words of appreciation!
  
**Abdur-Rahmaan:** Perhaps if you niyyah was correct, you wouldn&#8217;t be thinking like that. If only you were doing it sincerely for the sake of Allah and expecting reward only from Him. I think you need to see a heart specialist and get some x-rays!

**Zaid:** What?!?! But I&#8217;m not sick?
  
**Abdur-Rahmaan:** I am talking about the hidden disease of Riya. Its very hard to recognize. Imagine a black ant over a black road on a dark night; that&#8217;s how hard it is to recognize it. Riya means &#8220;to perform acts which are pleasing to Allah, with the intention of pleasing other than Allah.&#8221; You need to x-ray your heart and find the intentions behind your actions.

**Zaid:** Hmm &#8230; how do recognize this disease? What are the symptoms?
  
**Abdur-Rahmaan:** The primary cause of riya is a weakness of eman. When a person does not have strong faith in Allah, he will prefer the admiration of people over the pleasure of Allah. Here are some of the symptoms:

  1. Love of Paradise: You must have heard the hadith about first three people to be thrown into the fire of Hell: the scholar, the martyr and the person who gave his money in charity. All three of these people desired the praise of people, over and above the pleasure of Allah.
  2. Fear of Criticism: Some people obey certain commandments of lslam, not for the sake of Allah, but because they fear people will look down on them and criticize them if they does not do it. eg: praying in jam&#8217;ah, woman wearing hijab at mosque etc

Lastly, if you discover that you are doing good deeds only in public, and doing evil deeds when you are alone, this is an indication that you are falling into riya! Tell me one thing&#8211;what if I ask you to volunteer, for example, in a parking lot, where no one would see you and wouldn&#8217;t know about it. Would you do it?

**Zaid:** Hmmmm &#8230; I guess you are right. How do I treat and cure this disease?
  
**Abdur-Rahmaan:** Here are some of the best ways:

  1. Duaa! The prophet (sallallaahu \`alayhi wa salam) taught the specific duaa for riya:<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-613" title="Dua for Protection from Shirk" src="http://www.ilmfruits.com/wp-admin/wp-content/uploads/dua-for-shirk.gif" alt="" />[O Allaah, I take refuge in You lest I should commit shirk with You knowingly and I seek Your forgiveness for what I do unknowingly.]
  2. Hiding one&#8217;s good deeds. Do them where nobody can see!
  3. Reflection upon&#8217;s oneself&#8217;s shortcomings.
  4. Accompanying the pious (and good companionship helps with many things).
  5. Knowledge of Riya, the evilness of it.
  6. Always ask yourself why you&#8217;re doing something, and if you&#8217;d still do it if nobody but Allah knew about it.

**Zaid:** Jazakallah khairan bro, any final piece of advice?
  
**Abdur-Rahmaan:** Usually when I feel like getting praised or someone praises me, I remind myself of the response of the righteous slave of Allah when they feed people:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَاء وَلَا شُكُوراً. إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْماً عَبُوساً قَمْطَرِيراً
</div>

**Translation:** We feed you only for the countenance of Allah . We wish not from you reward or gratitude. Indeed, We fear from our Lord a Day austere and distressful. [Surah Al-Insaan, verses 9-10]
