Death. It&#8217;s inevitable. It&#8217;s one of the certainties of life. <span class="gem">No one denies it and no one can escape it.</span> And once you&#8217;re dead, your good deeds stop. Except in the following ways:

Abu Hurayrah (رضالله عنه) reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;When a human being dies, all of his deeds are TERMINATED, except for three types:
  
1. An ongoing charity (aka sadaqah jariyah)
  
2. A knowledge (of Islam) from which others benefit,
  
3. A righteous child who makes du&#8217;aa for him.&#8221; [Muslim and others].

<div class="miniTitle">
  Ongoing Charity
</div>

Ongoing charity is basically a charity given for the sake of Allah that continues to bring benefit. It&#8217;s like a system that you establish (or help establish): once its in place, <span class="gem">you reap rewards while it remains!</span>

Ongoing charity may mean building a mosque, buying Mushafs (copies of the Quraan) to be placed in a place of worship, establishing an endowment fund to help the poor, the orphans, the needy, the seekers of knowledge, etc. It can even be a good word that you speak to someone, and as a result of it the person is inspired to do some good deed.

So find out (or start) a means of sadaqah jariyah, help them out with your time and money, encourage good deeds and speak good, and finally (and most importantly) pray that Allah accepts and blesses your efforts! **It&#8217;s the tried and tested way of the pious predecessors and the &#8216;ulema (scholars) before us!**

<div class="miniTitle">
  Knowledge of Islam
</div>

<span class="gem">This is knowledge of an aspect of Islam that you learned and then conveyed to someone, and they act upon it.</span> It can be an ayah of Quran, a blessed hadith of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), or a reliable scholarly opinion.

The first step before imparting knowledge onto others is that you **learn it yourself first!!** How, you ask? Read the Quran daily, read ahadith daily (Riyadh us Saliheen is excellent), attend the Quran halaqah at the local Masjid, travel to seek knowledge (e.g. AlMaghrib classes in Toronto) &#8230; and pray **rabbi zidni ilma** (My Lord, Increase me in knowledge)! KNOW that there is NO EXCUSE for not seeking knowledge! <span class="gem">Not having time ain&#8217;t gonna cut it on the Day of Judgement.</span>

Remember:

<div class="quran">
  شَهِدَ اللّهُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَالْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ الْعِلْمِ قَآئِمَاً بِالْقِسْطِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ
</div>

**Translation:** Allah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness)&#8221; [Surah Al-Imran, verse 18]. SubhanAllah, look the EXALTED company that Allah mentions the people of knowledge in! Don&#8217;t you want to be a part of this?

Once you have some knowledge, spread it. Talk to your friends about what you learned. Tell your parents, your siblings, and your relatives. Start a blog. Reflect upon that amazing ayaat that you learned yesterday, and keep talking about it. And most importantly, **pray that Allah accepts and blesses your efforts!**

<div class="miniTitle">
  Righteous Children
</div>

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;A man&#8217;s status will be raised in Paradise, and he will ask, &#8216;How did I get here?&#8217; He will be told, &#8216;By your son&#8217;s du&#8217;aa&#8217;s (prayers) for forgiveness for you.&#8221; (Reported by Ibn Maajah, no 3660; see also Saheeh al-Jaami&#8217;, 1617)

<span class="gem">So make du&#8217;aa for your parents, whether they are dead or alive.</span> This is a sign of true love for them (unlike a father&#8217;s/mother&#8217;s day gift!) And if you have children, teach them to make du&#8217;aa for you! May Allah accept from all of us, ameen.

Allahumma innee as&#8217;aluka ilman naafian, wa rizqan tayyiban, wa &#8216;amalan mutaqabbilan.
  
Oh Alllah! Give me ilm (knowledge) that is beneficial, and rizq (sustenance) that is clean/pure/halal, and deeds that are accepted. Ameen!
