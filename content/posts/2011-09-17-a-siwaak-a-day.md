This is the continuation of the series, that focuses on implementing sunnah in our lives. I hope everyone had emaan rushed Ramadhan and you were able to apply the things we learned in this series.

Here is the sunnah items, we will be focusing on in this week:

**Using Siwak:**

  * Performing Prayers [<a href="http://quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/002.013.012.html" target="_blank">Bukhari :: Book 2 :: Volume 13 :: Hadith 12</a>]
  * Entering the house [Aaishah was asked what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did when he first came home. She said, “When he entered his house, the first thing he would do was to use the siwaak.” (Reported by Muslim, 1/220) ]
  * Upon waking up [Bhukari: <a href="http://quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/001.004.246.html" target="_blank">Book 1 :: Volume 4 :: Hadith 246</a>,  Bhukari: <a href="http://quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/002.021.237.html" target="_blank">Book 2 :: Volume 21 :: Hadith 237</a>]
  * Making Ablution [<a href="http://quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/003.031.154.html" target="_blank">Bukhari :: Book 3 :: Volume 31 :: Hadith 154</a>]
  * When reading Qur’aan and joining gatherings in which Allaah is remembered
  * When the smell of one’s mouth changes, whether this is because of eating food with a strong odour, or because of not eating or drinking for a long time, etc

**Action Item:**

  1. Buy Siwak and start using it
