What if you were asked to praise Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) in the best possible way, using the best possible words? What words would you pick? Subhanallah, look at the words of our beloved prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم):

Juwairiya (رضي الله عنها) reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) came out from her apartment in the morning as she was busy in observing her Fajr prayer in her place of worship. He came back in the forenoon and she was still sitting there. He (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said to her: You have been in the same seat since I left you. She said: Yes. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said:

<span class="gem">I recited four <dfn title="words, or phrases">kalimaat</dfn> three times after I left you, and if these are to be weighed against what you have recited since morning these would outweigh them</span> and (these words) are:

  <p>
    Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih, &#8216;adada khalqihi, wa ridaa nafsihi, wazinata &#8216;arshihi, wa midaada kalimaatihi (<strong>Glory and praise be to Allaah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of His words</strong>) [Shaheeh Muslim: Book 35, Number 6575]
  </p>

    What are some of the lessons that we can learn from this hadith? Devotion of Juwairiya (رضي الله عنها) after converting to Islam, importance and manners of giving nasiha, how the ummah <strong>benefitted</strong> from wives of the prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). The main lesson that we want to focus on today is:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span class="gem">Sometimes we just have to be smart instead of working hard! You can earn lots of hasanats in a short time by just being smart.</span> Subhanallah the ahdkars taught to us by Rasulullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) are very small, don&#8217;t take much time and don&#8217;t cost you anything! No matter how busy we get, we can always spare few minutes for these adkhars.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To get the maximum benefit out of these adhkars and to make it into a habith, we would Inshallah focus on one zikhar every week. While you are reciting this dikhar this week, pay close attention to the meaning of each phrase. Inshallah we will look at some of these phrases in future posts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do not forget to recite these beautiful words whenever you get a chance this week? Will You?
