Attaining Jannah can be easy _if_ we want it to be. The choice is ours to make. Just [take a step towards Allah][1] (سبحانه وتعالى) and watch!

To make things easy, it is reported that Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: **“Whoever recites Ayatul-Kursi immediately after each prescribed prayer, there will be nothing standing between him and his entering Paradise except death.”** (Reported by An-Nasa’i and Ibn Hibban)

Who does not have the time to do this? Subhanallah! How much easier could it get?

Lets make it a goal to observe each prescribed prayer and lets reap the bounty of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) by reciting ayatul-kursi immediately after so that we may be among those who enter Jannah, inshallah ta&#8217;alla.

You can find the arabic text of Ayatul-Kursi along with other great benefits in: [The Greatness of Ayat al-Kursi][2]
