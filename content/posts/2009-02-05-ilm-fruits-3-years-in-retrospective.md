Alhamdulillah, it&#8217;s been three years since Ilm Fruits started as a fledgling blog&#8211;one of very few at that time&#8211;with a few posts here and there. A lot has changed over that time; the blog has evolved.

Now it&#8217;s your chance to give back. I want to hear from **you, _personally_,** what you liked and didn&#8217;t like, what kinds of things you want to see from the blog in the future.

You can comment on anything&#8211;the design, the types of things you&#8217;d like to see&#8211;and also what you want in terms of content. You can say things like:

  * There used to be a big orange RSS button; bring it back!
  * Email notification is very, very useful
  * We want more polls/forums/etc.
  * The podcasts were/weren&#8217;t good.
  * Rating posts would be nice (1-5 star rating) 
      * We want to see the most popular and highest-rated posts on the front page
      * etc.</ul> 
    Anything you can possibly imagine; anything you&#8217;ve seen on other blogs, even.
    
    Please also mention content&#8211;what do you want to know more about? Arabic grammar? Stories of the sahaba? Fiqh of salaah? Marriage? Seerah? Aqeedah?
    
    Insha&#8217;Allah we&#8217;re in the process of revamping, and we&#8217;ll take this very seriously. So go ahead&#8211;give me what you got.
