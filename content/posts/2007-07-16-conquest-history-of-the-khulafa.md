</div>

[Conquest: History of the Khulafa][1] is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Muhammad Alshareef.

&#8220;Follow my sunnah and the sunnah of the _Khulafa Rashideen_.&#8221; Advice from the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) to all of humankind&#8211;to stick to the sunnah, and follow the _Khulafa Rashideen_, the righteous Khalifas.

But do we know who the Khulafa Rashideen _are_? Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthmaan, and &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنهم)&#8211;may Allah be pleased with them all. Do we know their personalities, their rise to Islam, the things they did for the deen? The battles they fought, the fitnah they turned away, the deviation they destroyed? Their heights of victory, their assassinations?

Read on, and learn about these four men, four men promised Paradise by the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) himself. May Allah allow us all to benefit from their amazing lives and examples, ameen!
