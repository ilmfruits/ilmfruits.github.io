    What does it mean to say 'La Illaha Ill Allah'? Has one every truly sat back and wondered what makes this one testimony so special? What makes this the differentiation point between one who believes and one who doesn't? Truly, it is every Muslims responsibility to comprehend fully what this Kalimah entails, because without it, one has not fulfilled the conditions of this testimony. Someone asked a scholar of the past, "is not the Shahada the key to Jannah?" He replied, "Yes, but every key has ridges, so if you come with the a key with the right ridges, the door will open, otherwise it will not."  So the question to ask is... do you have the key to Jannah?
