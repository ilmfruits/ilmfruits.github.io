After the death of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), many tribes apostated from Islam. Some stopped paying <span class="foreignWord">zakaah</span> (poor-due), and some tribe leaders claimed prophethood. Many of the common people at that time lacked education. The emotional charge of the situation swept up many of the Muslims.

Protect yourself. If you allow the river of emotion to sweep you up, in a lot of cases, it _will_ misguide you towards the wrong direction. The solution? Allahu &#8216;alim, look at the larger picture and the majority of the Muslims, not just what your own country perpetrates.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
