While FIFA World Cup blares over TV, reports on the radio, articles in the paper, we see our friends, our family, our co-workers, all of them glued to this new world.

Here are eleven reasons to unglue them (and yourself!) inshallah ta&#8217;ala:

  1. I will be **questioned on the Day of Judgement** about how I squandered and wasted my time.
  2. **Who are those guys** running around like headless chickens kicking that ball? Why should they matter to me?
  3. I still need to **memorize the Qur&#8217;an** or **learn how to pray properly**, so why am I watching FIFA instead?
  4. I **veg on the couch** and **consume large quantities of junk food** during matches&#8211;but imagine how much exercise I could get if I _played_ soccer half that much!
  5. There are better ways to **make the best use of our limited time**, like sitting with family, discussing with friends, going for a walk, learning something new and useful, etc.
  6. It **keeps me distracted** from the bigger things in life &#8212; getting rid of injustice oppressers have instilled, spreading the message of Islam (especially in light of the 17 arrests in Canada), etc.
  7. I can **start a business** or an **exciting new da&#8217;wa project** and get as much fun (and more benefit!) out of that!
  8. The time I spend watching is **preventing me from giving others their due rights**&#8211;like my parents.
  9. I could be watching something beneficial (and minus the partly-dressed women during commercial breaks) like [Foundations of Islamic Studies][1] instead!
 10. **Death can strike at any moment,** would I want to die with a bag of chips in one hand and &#8220;viva Portgual!&#8221; on my lips?
 11. It promotes **nationalism**. (Pop quiz: what did the Prophet <span class="gem">(صلي الله عليه وسلم) </span>say about nationalism?)

And this applies to **time-management (or mis-mangement) in general**, and not just World Cup specifically.

 ****May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) give us the tawfiq to use our time in the best way&#8211;the way that benefits us most in the akhir. Because when life ends, _that&#8217;s_ what really counts.

Don&#8217;t misunderstand&#8211;leisure time has its place in Islam. The companions used to use their leisure time&#8211;but _productively_. One of them said, that it refreshes his mind and helps him worship Allah better. Subhanallah.

So what are **you** doing with your lesiure time? Is it a spring-board to good deeds, or a gateway to sins?

Subhanallah, even _non-Muslims_ agree that we shouldn&#8217;t watch TV all the time!  You can read an interesting study on TV [here][2], and some more advice from Young Muslims on what to do about it [here][3].
