Often, non-Muslims question us about aspects of our faith. &#8220;Why do you wear hijab&#8221; or &#8220;why don&#8217;t you eat pork&#8221; or &#8220;why don&#8217;t you drink or date&#8221;.

And we get defensive and mangle our explainations. &#8220;Well alcohol&#8217;s not good for you&#8221; or &#8220;pigs are dirty&#8221; and so on. Which is **not correct**.

The answer to all these questions is very, very simple:

<p class="gem">
  Because Allah or His Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said so.
</p>

That&#8217;s it. Done. Finished. Best of all, your reasons can never be negated&#8211;for example, one might say &#8220;well, pigs are no longer as dirty and viral as they used to be.&#8221; _Then_ what are you going to say?

Speak the truth!

And, when you finally reach that level of &#8220;well what are some of the benefits we extract from this&#8221;, then you can peer into the wisdom behind the ruling and learn a few of the benefits, but in a limited way. Often times (for example, <span class="foreignWords">masseh</span>&#8211;wiping over the top of your socks for wudoo, not the bottom) we simply don&#8217;t know the reason for the ruling.

Allah alone knows best.

May Allah help us to accept and understand His rulings, ameen.

If you know any good examples of non-obvious rulings, comment them in inshaAllah. Jazakumullahu khayr.
