  Humankind witnesses Allah's blessings but turns the other way. "The son of Adam lies against me and abuses me ..." Allah is As-Samad, the Self-Sufficient.

Humankind is witness to the blessings that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has bestowed upon them, yet they look the other way. Humankind is witness to the world and everything in it, yet they deny the very Creator of it. Subhanallah.

Narrated Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) said: &#8216;The son of Adam tells a lie against Me, though he hasn&#8217;t the right to do so. He abuses Me, though he hasn&#8217;t the right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is his saying that I will not recreate him as I created him for the first time. In fact, to repeat or to recreate a thing is easier for the one who has created it for the first time. (So, it is easier for Me to repeat or recreate a creation which I created first). As for his abusing Me, it is his saying that Allah has begotten a son, while I am The One, As-Samad (the Self-Sufficient Master Whom all creatures need, neither I ear nor I drink.) I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none like or co-equal or comparable unto Me.'&#8221; (Sahih Bukhari)

This hadith Qudsi brings out the essence of the verse:

<p align="center">
  <strong>As-Sammad, &#8220;The Self-Sufficient Master (Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks)&#8221;<br /> </strong>&#8211; Surah al-Ikhlas verse 2
</p>

All Muslims are aware of this of surah in the Qur&#8217;an; we know it, we recite it, but do we understand it? It&#8217;s one of the first surahs that we memorize as children, and the most often recited surah too. Yet, have we ever tried to take the time to understand the depth of this surah?

Imam Ahmad (رحمالله) recorded from Ubbay bin Ka&#8217;b (رضي الله عنه) that the idolators said to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) , &#8220;O Muhammad! Tell us the lineage of your Lord.&#8221; So Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) revealed:

<p align="center">
  <strong>&#8220;He is Allah, Al-Ahad (The One and Only). Allah, As-Sammad (Allah is the Self-Sufficient). Allah is He who begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is non comparable to Him.&#8221;</strong> (Surah al-Ikhlas)
</p>

At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir (رحمالله) added in their narration that he said,

&#8220;(As-Sammad) is One Who does not give birth, nor was He born, because there is nothing that is born except that it will die, and there is nothing that dies except that it leaves behind inheritance, and indeed Allah does not die and does not leave behind any inheritance. (And there is none comparable to Him.) This means that there is none similar to Him, none equal to Him and there is nothing at all like Him.&#8221;

<p class="gem">
  Know who Allah is, and you will find Him greater then you ever perceived. Know who Allah is, and you will find that He is the One, the Only. Know who Allah is, and you will find Him to be the source of all happiness and joy.
