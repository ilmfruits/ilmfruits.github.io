<p class="gem">
  Patience is active, not passive.
</p>

What does this mean? It mains patience doesn&#8217;t just &#8220;happen&#8221;. You must _strive_ for it. You have to actively remind yourself and _make_ yourself patient.

Also, remember that <span class="gem">Allah </span>(سبحانه وتعالى) <span class="gem">tests you with what you are not patient with</span>. If He <span class="gem" />(سبحانه وتعالى) <span class="gem"></span>tested you with things you already succeed at, how could you ever learn and grow?

For a classic example of patience, consult Surah Yusuf. In Yusuf (عليه سلام) is an excellent, excellent example of patience. Every test becomes increasingly more intense, and yet, you see Yusuf (عليه سلام) bearing with patience, through to the end. (I suggest you read it with tafseer from [tafsir.com][1].)

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grant us all patience in all aspects of our lives, ameen.
