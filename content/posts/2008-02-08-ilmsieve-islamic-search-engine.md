One of the amazing things about the internet, is that alhamdulillah, it&#8217;s possible to find dozens of different projects that benefit the Muslims.

One such project is [Ilm Sieve][1], an Islamic search engine. Built on top of Google technology, it filters out non-Islamic and un-Islamic sites to give you only the best of Islam on the web. Some of the benefits of Ilm Sieve are:

  * **Signal-to-Noise:** compared to searching on Google, almost all (if not all) the search-results you find in Ilm Sieve are from Islamic sites&#8211;so no more digging to find the Islamic sites in page five and six of the results!
  * **Qur&#8217;an and Hadith Search:** type any snippet of text from the Qur&#8217;an or a hadith and you&#8217;ll likely find the source&#8211;the search engine covers the Qur&#8217;an (English and Arabic), Bukhari, and Muslim.
  * **Sensitive Topics:** you can even search for sensitive topics like pornography (or any other topic you&#8217;re looking up) and you&#8217;ll find solid Islamic sites that talk about these issues! (If you searched it on Google, you&#8217;d find _very_ different results &#8230;
  * **Firefox Integration:** If you use Firefox, you can click on the little icon on the front page and search directly from Firefox!

Try it out and see for yourself, via this handy widget:
