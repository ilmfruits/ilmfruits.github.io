My Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I write these words not as one who has any superiority over you , whether in knowledge or deeds. I do not say these words to you as your parent or your teacher. I speak to you as your brother. Your brother, who was sitting amongst you just yesterday. Ask Mahmood, ask Abdulwahid , ask &#8216;Umer , &#8216;Umair, Rizwaan , Tawseef , Raza , Yasin. Ask all of them and ask those whom I failed to mention: Was I not sitting in the exact same spot that you are sitting in these days ? They will all reply in the affirmative. So I write these words to you not as someone distant, but as someone amongst you&#8230; one of you. 

Ya Shaab al Islaam! Think about why you are here , ask yourself and ask yourself again. And I mean why are you physically present, why are you breathing, why does your heart beat, why unlike any other creature , can hear these words and intelligently decipher them into clear and concise thoughts? You know the answers to these questions because you&#8217;ve heard them before. You already know that Allah (swt) says &#8221; I have not created the Jinn and the Ins except to Worship Me.&#8221; But have we ever actually arrived at these conclusions ourselves ? Have we utilized these facilities of hearing , seeing and understanding to come to this Absolute truth? The answer is that most of us have not&#8230; so when you hear these words tonight, do not let someone else think for you, but pay close attention and use the blessings bestowed upon you by Allah to come to your own conclusion. 

To start off Alhamdulillah , you are all Muslim. You are all of those who proclaim the Kalimah of Tawheed. _Laa Illaha Il Allah_. You were taught it when you were young, and by default you have it memorized by heart. But do you know the weight that these four words carry. These are the same words that each and every Prophet was sent down to spread, the same words that saved Yunus (as) from the whale, the same words that if they are put up against everything in the universe on a scale , the former would outweigh the latter. However this Kalimah cannot just be paid lip-service to; it has rights and responsibilities&#8230; So learn these rights of _Laa Illah Ill Allah_. This is not a joke . It wasn&#8217;t just idle talk when the Prophet (saw) taught us that this Kalimah is the prerequisite to enter Jannah. 

Allah (swt) says in the Quraan: 

_&#8220;Has not the time come for the hearts of the believers to engage in the dikr of Allah ? &#8220;_ 

My Brothers and Sisters , Allah is directly asking you a question to ponder over it. The Quraan is collecting dust right in front of you while Allah has said it is _Hudallil Mutaqeen_ _&#8220;Guidance for those who have Taqwa&#8221;_. Take it as your criterion. Use it as your reference. Study it and benefit from this miracle in times of ease so that it may be your companion in times of hardship. By Allah , and believe my words, when your hearts are shook, and you are experiencing real difficulty. It is only the words of Allah that will bring solace and comfort to your soul. 

Take care of those who have rights over you, especially your parents. Honour them and treat them well. Cherish the fact that they are with you and take advantage of their wisdom. 

Honour the masjid and be frequent in your visitation to it. Know that there are some who would do anything to just be able to pray 2 rak&#8217;ah, in the same spot that a lot of you are praying in right now. 

Set goals and prepare for tomorrow. Prepare for the day when you will meet your Lord all alone. Think about this for a second.<span>&nbsp; </span>Visualize what will happen. All the &#8220;halla gulla&#8221; of this dunya will be a distant thing. None of it will matter. They only currency in your hand will be your deeds even some of these will be taken away by those whom you abused, backbit or slandered in this dunya. 

Take care of your body and health. Eat modestly and stay healthy. Be grateful for all the variety of foods that are available to you. Again, think of those who are right round you, but cannot regularly nourish themselves with a proper meal. Think about the millions who go to sleep hungry. Have you EVER in your life experienced that – having to sleep on an empty stomach because there is nothing to eat? NO, we can always go to the kitchen fridge and find something&#8230; anything to fill the stomach even if it doesn&#8217;t taste great. Do shukr to Allah for this blessing before its taken away from you. 

This leads to my final piece of Naseeha. My dear Brothers and Sisters, <span>&nbsp;</span>Wake up and stop wasting your time. Remember, there is a reason why Allah (swt) created you. Distance yourself from laziness and be of a benefit to others. Stop living in a state of unawareness, for you don&#8217;t know how things can change in a blink of an eye. You have a role to play in the Ummah&#8230; so discover that role, Whatever it is, and work towards it. 

_&#8220;Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning , yet they turn away in heedlessness.&#8221;_
