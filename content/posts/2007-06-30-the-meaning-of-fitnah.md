  How do you determine if a gold coin is real or not? You test it. "Do people think they can say 'we believe', and they will not be tested?" Are YOU ready?

In the old days, back when people used to actually use _gold_ coins, forgeries abounded; so **how do you tell the difference between a _real_ gold coin and a _fake_ gold coin?** How can you tell the percentage that&#8217;s real or not?

The answer is, <span class="gem">you put it through a test</span>.

<div class="quran">
  أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوا أَن يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا <strong>وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ</strong><br /> وَلَقَدْ <strong>فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ</strong> فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَاذِبِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and **will not be tested?** And **We indeed tested those who were before them.** And Allah will certainly make known the truth of those who are true, and will certainly make known the falsehood of those who are liars (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test). [Surah Ankabut, 29:2-3] 

In fact, the **_very same word_** used here for &#8220;test&#8221; is fa-ta-na (same root as <dfn title="فِتْنَة">fitnah</dfn>). <span class="gem">Allah is telling us, that he <strong>will</strong> test us, for sure</span>; and this will be the tool to differentiate the **real Muslims and Mu&#8217;mins** from the smack-talkers.

May Allah () make us all successful in all our tests, and make us strong for the tests that are to come! Ameen!
