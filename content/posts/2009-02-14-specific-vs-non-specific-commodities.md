![Several apples in a basket][1]

In Islamic Finance, the shari&#8217;ah differentiates between two types of commodities (this is just one differentiation): specific, and non-specific.

**Specific:** &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell you _this_ Saheeh Bukhari printed in 2004 by Dar-us-Salaam that I&#8217;m holding in my hand.&#8221;
  
**Non-Specific:** &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell you _a copy of_ Saheeh Bukhari printed in 2004 by Dar-us-Salam.&#8221;

So if you own some large amount of inventory, or you sell in volume, or you have a bookstore, etc. you are probably selling non-specific items. Like those apples above. If you&#8217;re using Craig&#8217;s List, or eBay, you&#8217;re likely selling specific items (unless you&#8217;re bulk-selling).

Why does it matter? Because **specificity determines what to do in case a defect is found.**

  * With a **specific** commodity, the seller **must refund the value in case a defect is found.** You cannot offer an alternative product. No exchange, just refund.
  * With a **non-specific** commodity, the seller **may offer a refund or exchange.** And if the seller offers an exchange, **the buyer cannot force them to return money.**

Why does this matter? Because you need to **_implement shari&#8217;ah as much as possible in your lives_**. If you&#8217;re a buyer, and you&#8217;re returning something non-specific, and the vendor doesn&#8217;t offer a refund, only exchange, don&#8217;t force them to return money. That would be thulm.

Or if you&#8217;re a seller, and you&#8217;re selling specific items, make it clear that you issue refunds only, not exchanges. Or if you&#8217;re selling non-specific items, make it clear that you issue refunds and offer exchanges.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
