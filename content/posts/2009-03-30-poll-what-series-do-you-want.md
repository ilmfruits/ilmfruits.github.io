Alhamdulillah, all praise and thanks is due to Allah, who has made Ilm Fruits alhamdulillah a very successful blog. Our recent post on salah questions (and their answers) got a lot of questions (masha&#8217;Allah alhamdulillah), so we&#8217;re going to take it a step further and roll out &#8230; a series.

Insha&#8217;Allah, starting April 6th (Monday), for the month of April, we&#8217;re going to have a series on a single topic. What does this mean?

  * We&#8217;ll post on the **same topic** continuously for the whole month (and maybe beyond for a week or two). This way, you get more depth of knowledge.
  * We&#8217;ll post **critical points**, or summaries of the key information in each topic.
  * We&#8217;ll **post action items** so you can start implementing your knowledge immediately, insha&#8217;Allah.
  * We will quiz you at the end with either a small quiz (ten multiple-choice questions?) or perhaps a longer test (ten short-answer questions?); this may **entail a prize** of some sort, depending on how it goes :)

And the most exciting part is &#8230; **_you_** get to pick the series topic! Below is a list of topics I feel comfortable teaching about (more or less all the classes I&#8217;ve taken). If you would like to learn about something additionally beyond this list, feel free to mention it in the comments.

Let the polling begin! Voting ends on April 5th at 11:59pm!
