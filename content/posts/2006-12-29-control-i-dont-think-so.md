Do you control your eyes? If so, then stop yourself from blinking. Do you control your heart? If so, then stop yourself from feeling. Do you control your brain? If so, then stop yourself from thinking.

Can’t do it, can you? If we’re not in control then who is?

Who else besides Al-Khaliq, The Creator &#8212; Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)

Reality Check … this <dfn title="this life">dunya</dfn> is not what it percieves to be, so next time we think we got things under control, we should think again, because more than likely we **don’t.**
