excerpt: "Reminders of the akhira can benefit our hearts.  Let us examine two words used in the Quran, Jahannam and Jaheem.  Jahannam means: a stern look, darkness, and a waterless cloud; Jaheem means a blazing firepit, the look of a lion at it's prey, and to kick up and stir up a fire.  Put these meanings together, and what do you get?  Hellfire, and what a wretched ending that is!"

Bismillah.

Reminders of the akhirah can have a great effect on our hearts and bring us out of the ghaflah (heedlessness) we are in. By looking at two words, Jahannam and Jaheem from the Qur&#8217;an, we are able to see what the real life is, the real ending and the real punishment. May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) make our best deeds our last and may He (سبحانه وتعالى) make us among those who will enter Jannah without reckoning or punishment. Ameen!

So how scary is Jahannam?

Jahannam (جهنم) is from jeem haa meem, and contains many meanings. Of those meanings are:

  * the literal meaning, **to meet with a frowning face and to have a stern look.** When you look at a person who has &#8220;jahm,&#8221; you become fearful.
  * **Darkness:** and jahm is used for the darkest part of the night. Aren&#8217;t you scared in darkness? Jahannam is a dark place where you don&#8217;t want to be alone.
  * **A waterless cloud**

Put these meanings together&#8211;Jahannam is a place when you look at it you&#8217;re scared&#8211;you want to run away and stay away from it because it has that frowning look and it is waterless. When Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&#8217;an about the disbelievers, &#8220;fahasbahu jahannam,&#8221; meaning &#8220;then Jahannam is sufficient for him&#8221;&#8211;THIS is what they deserve, a waterless, scary, dark punishment that will break their ego.

And what about Al-Jaheem?

Al-Jaheem (الجحيم) is from jeem haa meem, and contains many meanings. Of those meanings are:

  * The literal meaning, **to light and stir up a fire**&#8211;you add fuel and ensure it keeps burning.
  * The word Jahama means **to stare with sharp eyes, and refers to the way a lion stares at it&#8217;s prey.**
  * The word &#8220;ajham,&#8221; also from the same root, means **someone who has red eyes.**
  * Jaheem is also used to mean **a pit with blazing fire**&#8211;and not just any fire, but an extremely hot, intense, and fiercely-buring fire.

Next time Shaytan whispers to you and you are inclined to commit a sin, remember this description of Hellfire &#8230; like a lion staring at its prey.

Contrast this horrible resting place with Jannah! Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says about the Companions of Jannah, &#8220;la khawfun alayhim wa la hum yahzanoon,&#8221; they will have no fear (of the future) and they will not grieve (the past)&#8211;unlike the companions of Hellfire, who will be utterly terrified when they _see_ the punishment, nevermind when they _enter_it.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) make us among the Companions of the Paradise, ameen!

Indeed, Rasulullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) spoke the truth when he said, &#8220;O Allah, there is no life except for the life of the Hereafter, and there is no good except for the good of the Hereafter.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim]
