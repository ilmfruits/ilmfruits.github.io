I&#8217;ll tell you who can. **YOU!**

Thats right my brothers and sisters, recite a third of the Qur&#8217;an in just **one minute** every night!

How?

Al-Bukhari (رحمالله) recorded from Abu Sa\`id (رضي الله عنه), that the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said to his Companions, &#8220;Is one of you not able to recite a third of the Qur&#8217;an in a single night?&#8221; This was something that was difficult for them and they said, &#8220;Which of us is able to do that, O Messenger of Allah?&#8221; So he (صلي الله عليه وسلم) replied, &#8220;&#8216;_Say: Allah is the One, As-Samad&#8217;_ is a third of the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; [Bukhari and Muslim]

Subhanallah! Going to sleep? Get the reward for reciting a third of the Qur&#8217;an by reciting _**Surah Ikhlas**_. Waiting in a line? No problem! Take advantage and reap the rewards.

If you&#8217;re feeling brave, why not try for the **WHOLE** Qur&#8217;an and see how far you get?

Let&#8217;s take advantage. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has surely made it easy for us to reap His rewards, so what are we waiting for? Everyone recite it now and earn the reward and blessings of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).
