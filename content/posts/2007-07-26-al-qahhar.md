<div class="miniTitle">
  ٱلۡقَهَّارُ &#8211; Al Qahhar
</div>

The root word for ٱلۡقَهَّارُ is قَهر which is defined as:

  1. to compel something or someone against his/her wishes
  2. to subdue
  3. to overcome
  4. to force [1]

Thus, with regards to Allah (سبحانه وتعال), the noble name Al-Qahhar can be translated as &#8220;the Subduer, i.e. the Subduer of His creatures by His sovereign authority and power and the Disposer of them as He pleases, with and against their will.&#8221; [1]

Along with ٱلۡعَزِيزُ (the Powerful and Honorable) and ٱلۡجَبَّارُ (the Strong and Powerful), this noble name illustrates that Allah(سبحانه وتعال) has the supreme authority and power to do anything, and He can subdue or force anyone to compel to Allah’s Will against his/her wishes. This supreme power rests with only Allah (سبحانه وتعال). 

Allah (سبحانه وتعال) has said in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  أَفَغَيْرَ دِينِ اللّهِ يَبْغُونَ <strong>وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ</strong> طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** Do they seek other than the religion of Allah, **while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly.** And to Him shall they all be returned. [Al-Imran: 83]

In this verse, Allah (سبحانه وتعال) is telling us that everything that is created submits to Allah (سبحانه وتعال) willingly or unwillingly, such is the power and force of Al-Qahhar. If we ponder over this ayah and look around us, we will see the amazing truth in it. For example, the gravity of earth and the planets ensure that humans can only make an object go only so far. The limitations of the body ensure that we can only go at a certain top speed and nothing more. Regardless of how advanced the technology becomes, this technology will be compelled and will be subdued by Al-Qahhar to comply to His will, whether it is willingly or unwillingly. That shows how finite and limited we are, and how grand, powerful and majestic is Allah (سبحانه وتعال). 

Also, this verse is telling us how foolish those people are who seek a religion other than the religion of Allah (سبحانه وتعال) – Islam – because these people are submitting to other object(s) of worship, whereas to Allah (سبحانه وتعال) submits everything willing or unwillingly, and to Allah (سبحانه وتعال) is the ultimate return. Such is the power and force of Al-Qahhar (سبحانه وتعال).

  Occurrence in the Quran
</div>

The name Al-Qahhar is found in the noun form in six ayaat of Quran. Amazingly, all six times the name الْوَاحِدُ (the One) is combined with Al-Qahhar. These six instances are:

<div class="miniTitle">
  1) Surah Yusuf
</div>

<div class="quran">
  يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ اللّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ
</div>

&#8220;O two companions of the prison! Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah, the One, Al-Qahhar?&#8221; [Yusuf:39]

<div class="miniTitle">
  2) Surah Ar-Rad
</div>

<div class="quran">
  قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ قُلِ اللّهُ قُلْ أَفَاتَّخَذْتُم مِّن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاء لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ لِأَنفُسِهِمْ نَفْعًا وَلاَ ضَرًّا قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الأَعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِي الظُّلُمَاتُ وَالنُّورُ أَمْ جَعَلُواْ لِلّهِ شُرَكَاء خَلَقُواْ كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ قُلِ اللّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ
</div>

Say (O Muhammad SAW): &#8220;Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?&#8221; Say: &#8220;(It is) Allah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Have you then taken (for worship) Auliya (protectors, etc.) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?&#8221; Say: &#8220;Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Allah is the Creator of all things, He is the One, Al-Qahhar.&#8221; [ArRad:16]

<div class="miniTitle">
  3) Surah Ibrahim
</div>

<div class="quran">
  يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الأَرْضُ غَيْرَ الأَرْضِ وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ
</div>

On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they (all creatures) will appear before Allah, the One, Al-Qahhar. [Ibrahim:48]

<div class="miniTitle">
  4) Surah Sad
</div>

<div class="quran">
  قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَنَا مُنذِرٌ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَهٍ إِلَّا اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ
</div>

Say (O Muhammad SAW): &#8220;I am only a warner and there is no Ilah (God) except Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) the One, Al-Qahhar. [Sad:65]

<div class="miniTitle">
  5) Surah Az-Zumar
</div>

<div class="quran">
  الَوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَنْ يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا لَّاصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاء سُبْحَانَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ
</div>

Had Allah willed to take a son (or offspring or children), He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! (He is above such things). He is Allah, the One, Al-Qahhar. [Az-Zumar:4]

<div class="miniTitle">
  6) Surah Ghafir
</div>

<div class="quran">
  يَوْمَ هُم بَارِزُونَ لَا يَخْفَى عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَيْءٌ لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ
</div>

The Day when they will (all) come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allah. Whose is the kingdom this Day? (Allah Himself will reply to His Question): It is Allah&#8217;s the One, Al-Qahhar! [Ghafir:16]

The reasons why Allah (سبحانه وتعال) chose to combine these two names (الْوَاحِدُ and Al-Qahhar) together at every mention of the name Al-Qahhar are known only to Allah. However, one can see that one of the reasons for this coupling could be that Allah (سبحانه وتعال) is trying to emphasize that there is only, exclusively, unquestionably one Al-Qahhar. In other words, there is no one who is that powerful and mighty such that they can force and subdue all of the creation – willingly or unwillingly – to comply with their will. No one has this capability, except Allah, الْوَاحِدُ (the One) ٱلۡقَهَّارُ, Exalted is He (سبحانه وتعال).

Also, one can see this combination is done every time, in all six instances in the Quran. This is to further emphasize the afore-mentioned point that truly, unmistakably there is only One Al-Qahhar.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Explanation of Two Verses
</div>

The following is an explanation of two ayaat from the afore-mentioned six ayaat.

The first ayah mentioned (in chronological order) is ayah 39 from Surah Yusuf. In the preceding ayaat, the story of Yusuf (عليه السلام) and his encounter with the wife of Aziz was mentioned. In the story, Yusuf (عليه السلام) was imprisoned even though he had not committed any crime and the entire fault laid with the wife of Aziz. In prison, he was approached by two prisoners who wanted to ask Yusuf (عليه السلام) about the interpretation of their dreams. Yusuf (عليه السلام) took this opportunity to do some da&#8217;wah, even though he was imprisoned! In his da&#8217;wah, he first disassociates himself from the religion and practises of the people of Egypt and then mentions his religion, the religion of Allah. He then poses an intriguing and awe-inspiring question: Are many gods better, or is Allah, الْوَاحِدُ (the One) ٱلۡقَهَّارُ, better? 

The question is obviously hypothetical because the answer is so obvious. How can the acceptance of and worship of multiple gods make any sense when Allah, the True God, is One and Allah is Al-Qahhar, and ONLY Allah is Al-Qahhar? The mention of Al-Qahhar emphasizes that Allah is the One who is so powerful and mighty that He can force and subdue all of the creation – willingly or unwillingly – to comply to His Will. So why, then, worship anyone else who itself is submitting to Allah (سبحانه وتعال)? 

The last ayah mentioned (in chronological order) is ayah 16 from Surah Ghafir. The ayah is very clear, explicit and dripping with majesty and grandeur. Allah (سبحانه وتعال) is telling us about the Day of Judgement, and how on that day when all of mankind will be summoned abruptly from their graves, nothing on that day will be hidden from Allah (سبحانه وتعال). The مَـٰلِكِ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّين will show everyone who is the King and the Master on this day of chaos: it is none other than Allah, الْوَاحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّارُ. 

The mention of Al-Qahhar emphasizes in very clear and certain terms that Allah will subdue everyone and force everyone on that day to comply with His Will. For example, we know from Surah Tariq, ayah 10 that on the Day of Judgment, man will have neither power nor any helper except Allah, الْوَاحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّارُ. We also know that no one can intercede for anyone except by Allah&#8217;s leave, nor can anyone help anyone else on this day. So truly, everyone without exception on this day will be subdued and forced to comply – willingly or unwillingly – with the Will of Allah and only Allah, الْوَاحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّارُ, Exalted is He above the seven heavens (سبحانه وتعال).
