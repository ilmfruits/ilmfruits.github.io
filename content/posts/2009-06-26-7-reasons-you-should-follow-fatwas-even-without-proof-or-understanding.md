excerpt: "I was recently asked a comment about what the proof is regarding something which I quoted from one of my shuyookh. I would like to explain, therefore, my own ideas and understanding on what to do with fatwaa--which ones to follow and not follow; how to understand a fatwa; and why you need to follow people of knowledge, even if you don't understand what they're saying or how they derive that ruling. Because Allah says: ask the people of knowledge if you don't know."

Bismillahi Ar-Rahmaan Ar-Raheem.

I hope you will all excuse a slight diversion from our series of Tafseer Juz &#8216;Amma; and I hope you will not mind a bit of time lapse; due to personal affairs that required my attention, and illness, I have been unable to post until now.

Some of you may have read our [Salah Q&A thread][1]; I was recently asked a comment about what the proof is regarding something which I quoted from one of my shuyookh.

I would like to therefore present my own ideas and understanding of this issue, as I have surmized from several classes, lectures, and halaqaat; I stress that this is _my own understanding_, based on what I have learned.

If you&#8217;re not interested, the summary of this discussion is **ask the people of knowledge, and follow what they say, regardless of if you understand the proofs or not, regardless if they are given or not.** The proof of this is the ayah of Allah: ask the people of knowledge if you don&#8217;t know [21:7] and the hadith of rasulullah, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, about the man who made ghusl with a head-wound and died from it; the Messenger of Allah told those people who issued that fatwa: why didn&#8217;t you ask if you didn&#8217;t know? And if you don&#8217;t understand, you will fall down the wrong path, without doubt.

I know that many of you will disagree with this; and if so, you are obliged to follow **what you think is right** because Allah will ask you about your opinions and me about my opinions, and not the other way around.

The main question that arises is: when should you ask for proof on an opinion, and when should you follow it?

There are several intricate cases here to think about; any of the following could occur when you ask for an opinion on a matter:

  * **You get an answer, without proof.** I am assuming, in this case, that you trust the scholar, alim, or student of knowledge who stated the opinion. There are two cases here&#8211;either the person knows the proof themselves, or they don&#8217;t; maybe they had time to mention it to you. Or maybe they didn&#8217;t.
  * **You get an answer, with proof.** Usool-ul-Fiqh teaches us that there are many, many types of proofs, and rules of precedence, and even difference of opinion around what are these rules and order of precedence. In this case, there are two sub-cases: either you **do** understand the proof, or you **don&#8217;t** understand the proof.

Sometimes we might have a case where a little knowledge is dangerous; you might take an usool-ul-fiqh class, then ask (or read about) two fatwas on an issue by two scholars you trust, with conflicting opinions. One gives proof, one doesn&#8217;t; and perhaps the one knowing the proofs, didn&#8217;t give it, and the one who gave it, has the wrong opinion! So then, knowing usool-ul-fiqh, you say &#8220;I need to follow the one who follows the right methodology,&#8221; and you might follow the wrong opinion! Subhanallah!

The other core, fundamental issue is that **we are not qualified to make ijtihaad.** We cannot, ourselves, arrive at the right rulings; we have neither the knowledge, nor the tools, to do so. Becoming a mujtahid requires _years_ upon years of studying; issuing fatawa takes wisdom and experience to know the context and the far-flung ramifications of your fatwa.

And to add _more_ spice, you can throw in all the difference of opinion on top!

So what&#8217;s a person to do? I repeat my summary statement&#8211;**ask people of knowledge, who you trust, and whom you think have knowledge, and _take what they say and run with it._** Don&#8217;t think about it or question it too much, you don&#8217;t have the tools to decipher it!

I know that in North America, we have this very dangerous method of picking apart fatwas we don&#8217;t like, and following our own desires, wa na&#8217;oodhubillah, a lot of times.

So what are these seven reasons that I mentioned in the title? Seven reasons why you may not get, or understand, a fatwa, and should follow it regardless?

  1. **The shaykh may know the proof, but lack time to explain them.** This happens frequently in AlMaghrib classes, or in circles where time is limited. It may also happen if, for the shaykh, this is something he&#8217;s learned and seen over and over and _over and over_ and over, and is so well-established that it doesn&#8217;t need to be reinstated (like mortgages being haraam). **There is proof here, but you don&#8217;t have it.** So if you say &#8220;no proof, no deal,&#8221; you will be _leaving a correct opinion based on YOUR understanding that it&#8217;s wrong._ And who are you to make that call? See point #2:
  2. **We are not qualified to make ijtihaad.** The number of sciences you need to know, proofs, difference of opinion, the wisdom of giving fatwaa&#8211;the sheer amount of knowledge you need to know and _apply correctly_, not just know, is staggering! Most of us will sadly never reach this high, high plateau of knowledge. So you may be **making ijtihaad in sin, because you&#8217;re not qualified to do so**. Whereas you may ask someone who asked someone (for example, you may ask Muhammad Alshareef, who asked his shuyookh, who _is_ qualified to make ijtihaad) and **reject legitimate ijtihaad**.
  3. **The person you&#8217;re asking can make ijtihaad, or asked people who can make ijtihaad.** You&#8217;re not just getting an ignorant layman opinion here&#8211;somewhere, someone _with the knowledge and tools_ took the time to research an opinion from every angle and derive a final answer&#8211;whether it was a sahaba, or one of the four great imams, or someone lesser than them. (This is why it&#8217;s so important to use their opinions and their proofs sometimes.)
  4. **Allah says, ask the people of knowledge.** Because not everyone reaches that level of knowledge; and Allah didn&#8217;t say _ask them for their proofs!_ We know from the seerah that sometimes, bedouins came to Rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked him, and he didn&#8217;t give them any proof! You can argue that he&#8217;s the Messenger of Allah, and your &#8216;alim or shaykh is just a man; but my point is that _you have to ask people of knowledge._ Even if you don&#8217;t understand their proofs. Which is point #4:
  5. **You don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t understand the proof.** This happens in issues of salah and finance and &#8216;aqeedah and everything in-between. Sometimes, the depth of knowledge that an &#8216;alim extracted, you might not understand how he did it, or why he did it, or what tool he used to legitimize that extraction. In this case, you are **rejecting a legitimate ijtihaad based on ignorance.**
  6. **If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t try to understand.** Shaykh Yasir Qadhi mentions in his tafseer of Surah Yusuf on AudioIslam, that for _the one who cannot understand and deal with differences of opinion and proofs, the scholars say, he **just has to follow what he&#8217;s told**, and no more._ This is really the crux of it&#8211;if you don&#8217;t know, and you can&#8217;t understand, _trust the people of knowledge_. If you can&#8217;t trust them, find other people of knowledge who you deem knowledgeable and trustworthy!
  7. **You may read an ayah or hadith that&#8217;s abrogated, or that is not the best proof.** Assuming that it even _is_ a legitimate proof&#8211;sometimes things are quoted out of context&#8211;how do you know it&#8217;s not abrogated? Or that it&#8217;s the proof of a weak opinion? Or that the majority of ulama reject that proof? You don&#8217;t! Sometimes people say, &#8220;the hadith is _clear_,&#8221; and they run with it&#8211;and this is not the best approach! You may be following something that IS an authentic hadith or ayah, but is not the right proof for the right opinion for that issue! A typical example is those Muslims who drink alcohol, may Allah guide and forgive them&#8211;Allah revealed multiple ayaat, gradually putting people off alcohol; some people quote the early ayaat _before alcohol was abrogated_ and use that as a proof that it&#8217;s permissible. This is **totally the wrong understanding and methodology, and this is what happens when you follow your _own_ understanding.**

I would like to conclude by saying that our deen is **based on knowledge, not ignorance**&#8211;as Allah says, &#8220;Iqraa!&#8221; Read! The first ayah ever revealed&#8211;showing the importance of knowledge.

And **every scholar, shaykh, mujtahid, &#8216;alim, imam, and individual makes mistakes.** This is part of our human experience. Having said that, **the reward for an incorrect ijtihaad is 1x; and the reward of correct ijtihaad is 2x.**

So save yourself on the Day of Judgment. Follow someone else&#8217;s opinion, and let the burden of ijtihaad and proof and everything else be on _their_ head, not yours. You&#8217;re not qualified, and I&#8217;m not qualified; so we need to _ask_.

And the crux of the matter is: _who do you trust?_ How do you know who is legitimate and who is not? I would say&#8211;as one of my shuyookh said&#8211;that you **follow people of akhlaaq and &#8216;ilm**. Ultimately, you have to judge for yourself who to follow. **Ask Allah to guide you to the truth, and to guide you to people of knowledge.** If you are insha&#8217;Allah sincere, Allah will bring you _legions_ of people like this who you can trust, and who will clarify for you As-Siraat Al-Mustaqeem, the straight path.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.

If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about the methodology of scholars, you can start with our posts on Code of Scholars; and [buy the CD set from Eman Rush][2]. It&#8217;s one of the most easy-to-understand courses I&#8217;ve seen on what is a very deep and technical science. I guarantee it&#8217;ll frazzle your brain for a few weeks&#8211;I know it took me several weeks before I could fully digest and understand all the details.
