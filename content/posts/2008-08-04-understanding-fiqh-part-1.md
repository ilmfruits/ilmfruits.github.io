Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wasalam &#8216;ala Rasool Allah

When we begin to talk about a field of study in the religion of Islam it is very imperative we begin by defining the terms; making clear the terminology which is used throughout that field of study. With that said, I want to focus on Fiqh.

Linguistically, _fiqh_ is defined as the true understanding of what is intended. For example: The true understanding of Anatomy, the true understanding of Plants, or the true understanding of Religion. All of these exemplify the linguistic understanding of _fiqh._ When applied to Islam, _fiqh_ means the science of deducing Islamic Laws from evidences found in the sources of Islamic Law.

Another term which we must define is _sharee&#8217;ah._ This term, linguistically, means a waterhole or the straight/ordained/clear way. When applied to Islam, _sharee&#8217;ah_ means the the totality of Islamic Laws which:

  1. Were revealed to the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam
  2. Are recorded in the Qur&#8217;an
  3. Can be deduced from the Prophet&#8217;s sunnah

From these two definitions of _fiqh_ and _sharee&#8217;ah,_ the following may be deduced:

  1. _Sharee&#8217;ah_ is revealed laws found in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah while _fiqh_ is a body of laws deduced from the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah to cover situations **not directly** treated in the _sharee&#8217;ah.
  
_ 
  2. _Sharee&#8217;ah_ is fixed; it doesn&#8217;t change over time. _Fiqh_ changes as circumstances change.
  3. _Sharee&#8217;ah_ is mostly general; laying down the basic principles. _Fiqh_ tends to be specific; how the basic principles of _sharee&#8217;ah_ should be applied in different situations.
