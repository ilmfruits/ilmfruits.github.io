We live in an era where knowledge is abundant and is available at our finger tips in variety of formats (audio, video, ebooks&#8230;) and on variety of devices and platforms (tablets, smartphones, laptops&#8230;.). However, we lack the enthusiasm,  passion, dedication and commitment to seeking knowledge. Here are few of the inspiring stories of past to rekindle that spark.

  * Imam Nawai mentioned to his students that  for 2 years, his sides didn&#8217;t touch any bed or earth in order to lie down and sleep. His students asked him &#8220;how did you sleep then&#8221;, he replied &#8220;when I would be overcome by sleep, I would lean over the books and then wake up again shortly after&#8221;. His students would tell that student there would be no space in his house, due to the pile of books. Not even a place to sit.
  * Asad ibn Furad (who was one of the greatest student of Imam Malik) travelled from his home (Andalusia) to Medina to study under Imam Malik. He then travelled to Iraq to learn from the students of Imam Abu Hanifa. When he came to Imam Muhammad bin Hasan Shaibani (one of the students of Imam Abu Hanifa), he said &#8220;I am a stranger in this land, I don&#8217;t have enough money. If I sit with the rest of the students, I will benefit less and you have so many students&#8221;. The imam replied &#8220;You join the students in the day time and to you I will dedicate the whole night. You can spend the entire night in my house.&#8221; Asad ibn Furad then said &#8220;I would spend the night in his house. He would come down to me and place between me and him, a vessel of water. If night becomes long and I would become sleepy, the Imam would take some water and would throw at my face to wake me up!&#8221;
  * Abu Musa went to another scholar in Egypt in order to take One hadith. When he reached there, he hasn&#8217;t even dismounted from horse, that he heard the hadith. He mounted his horse and started his journey back to Madina.
  * Iman Tahi would put bread in the soup and drink it. When asked about it, he said that if I were to chew it as opposed to drinking it as  soup, the time difference is enough to recite 50 verses of Quran.
  * <p style="display: inline !important;">
      Abu Bakar ibn khayar would study all the time, even while walking on the street. As a result, sometimes
    </p>
    
    he would fall into a  ditch, or fall from animal. His student Salab said that he was never seen walking without a book.</li> </ul> 
    
    There are many such stories.
