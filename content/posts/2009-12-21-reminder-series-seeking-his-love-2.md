Bismillah walhamdolilah wassalatu wassalam &#8216;ala rasool Allah

Here are ten ways to attain the love of Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala, as per Ibn al-Qayyim rahimuhallah:

> First, reciting the Qur’an while pondering over its meanings and what is meant by it.

Allah says, the meaning of which is: &#8220;Then do they not reflect upon the Qur&#8217;an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah , they would have found within it much contradiction&#8221; [4:82]

Allah rebukes those who do not ponder and reflect over the Qur&#8217;an. Thus, this verse is a means to motivate the believing men and women to reflect and ponder over the book of Allah so that they are not considered among that rebuked category of people.

In the tafsir of the above verse, Ibn Kathir rahimuhallah mentions:

Allah commands them to contemplate about the Qur&#8217;an and forbids them from ignoring it, or ignoring its wise meanings and eloquent words. Allah states that there are no inconsistencies, contradictions, conflicting statements or discrepancies in the Qur&#8217;an, because it is a revelation from the Most-Wise, Worthy of all praise. Therefore, the Qur&#8217;an is the truth coming from the Truth, Allah. This is why Allah said in another Ayah, &#8220;Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;an, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it.&#8221;

> Second, getting closer to Allaah by performing voluntary deeds after completing obligatory deeds. This is as is stated in a Hadith Qudsi: “&#8230;My slave continues getting closer to Me by performing voluntary deeds until I love him.”

The love of Allah will come after we take the steps in coming closer to Him, starting with what He has made an obligation upon us. This isn&#8217;t to say that its easy. It&#8217;s difficult job to struggle in worship and struggle to achieve His love. Initially, we may be weak and find it difficult and quit. However, if we stick with it,we will find our love for those deeds to grow within our hearts. And with the love of those deeds comes the love of the Most Loving, Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.

> Third, continual remembrance of Allaah under all circumstances, with one’s tongue, heart and actions. The extent of one’s love of Allaah is determined by this.

Allah says, the meaning of which is: &#8220;O you who believe! <span>Remember</span> <span>Allah</span> <span>with</span> <span>much</span> <span>remembrance&#8221; [33:41]</span>

> Fourth, giving precedence to what He loves over what you love when you are overtaken by your desires.

Truly, this is a sign of a believer and one who has submitted to Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. The lover will always put his lovers desires over his own. Then who is more worthy of loving than Allah?

> Fifth, the heart being avid of Allaah’s Names, and Attributes and the heart roaming in that garden of knowledge.

Indeed, knowledge brings about awareness and awareness bring about understanding and understanding brings about love. The one who loves seeks out the ways to love and ways to attain his lover&#8217;s love. In the same manner, the love of Allah is in knowing the deen, and implementing it in our lives. And of the greatest forms of knowledge is to have the knowledge of His beautiful Names and Attributes. By knowing His Names and Attributes, you begin to understand Allah, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth. And I ask you, who doesn&#8217;t want to know His Lord?

Allah says, the meaning of which is: &#8220;And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them&#8221; [7:180]

Stay tuned for the last five&#8230;
