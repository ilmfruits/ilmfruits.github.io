For those who missed the train for UIA&#8217;s two-year Arabic course, email <info@uia.ca> and ask them to put you on the waiting list. They&#8217;re planning on holding another session (same content, different teacher) starting in May inshaAllah.

**Register today.** There are only approximately _**ten**_ seats left!
