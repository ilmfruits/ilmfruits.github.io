  Ramadan kills all the excuses we make for ourselves throughout the year, and allows us to soar to new heights of eman!
</p>

If someone said to you, &#8220;let&#8217;s go to the masjid every day,&#8221; you&#8217;d say &#8220;we can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; but, in Ramdan, you do it! If someone said &#8220;let&#8217;s play Qiyam al-Layl all night,&#8221; you&#8217;d say &#8220;we can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; but, in Ramdan, you do it! Subhanallah, in Ramdan, wishes and hopes and dreams can become reality!

But why does this happen? Is it because of the well-known hadith that when Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise open, the gates of Hell lock, and the devils are shackled? [Bukhari [3/31/123][1], Muslim [6/2361][2]] Undoubtedly that&#8217;s part of it! But beyond that, we all raise our standards and transform things we _should_ do into things we _must_ do!

What are some common excuses that die gruesome deaths in Ramadan?

  * I can&#8217;t visit the masjid every day! (Taraweeh, anyone?)
  * I can&#8217;t pray long prayers regularly! (Taraweeh, anyone?)
  * Qiyam-al-Layl tires me out! (But you do it, for a _whole month_!)
  * Fasting Mondays and Thursdays is too hard! (But fasting one month straight isn&#8217;t?)
  * I can&#8217;t live without my coffee! (But you do, don&#8217;t you?)
  * I _need_ [beer/alcohol/cigarettes/other haram goods or activities] to survive! (But you survived fine without them!)
  * I can&#8217;t control my anger! (In ramadan, _you dont even argue!)_
  * I don&#8217;t get much time to read Qur&#8217;an! (In Ramadan, your recite the full quran!)
  * I can&#8217;t wakeup for Fajr! (In Ramadan, not only do you pray Fajr on time, but you also wake up at the _prime tahajjud time_&#8211;the last third of the night!_)_
  * I can&#8217;t tell my friends about Islam! (Was it so hard to tell them about fasting?)
  * _**Post the many excuses you killed in comments!**_ 

Interestingly, anything you do consistently for about 21 days becomes a habit&#8211;and the effort you need to keep doing it drops dramatically!

<p class="gem">
  So this Ramadan, purge yourself of some limiting excuses and enjoy the new heights of eman they can bring!
</p>

&#8220;Sure,&#8221; you might say, &#8220;but what about &#8216;Eid and beyond? How do I make sure I don&#8217;t backslide?&#8221;

If you _do_ backslide, don&#8217;t beat yourself up&#8211;after all, everyone makes mistakes. Remember&#8211;**you completed one month without giving in!** There&#8217;s no reason why you can&#8217;t do it again! So refine your action plan, remember your goal, and start over. And make **lots** of du&#8217;a, because the help of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is always near!

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) give us all success in reaching the highest peaks of eman through Ramadan and beyond, ameen!
