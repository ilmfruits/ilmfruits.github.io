Want to learn Arabic&#8211;or for that matter, any language&#8211;quickly? Transcend beyond what you learn in class? Fly past your peers in terms of knowledge and understanding? Want to achieve all this **without spending hours of time or hundreds of dollars?**

Well, the solution is here&#8211;and it&#8217;s already available to you! All you need is a pen, some paper, and a mushaf (copy of the Qur&#8217;an)&#8211;and, most importantly, _your brain_!

<div class="miniTitle">
  Read
</div>

Read and recite the Qur&#8217;an. Every day (which you should already be doing _anyway_&#8211;it came down as guidance, not an ornament for your bookshelf). The key here is **before you turn to a translation, pick out constructs you know.** Recgonize a couple of words? Maybe that looks like a feminine plural? Did you spot that harf ul-jarr that gave the noun kasra? What about that word, does it look like a verb conjugation? And so on. **Maximize your efforts to understand _before_ you translate.**

<div class="miniTitle">
  Think
</div>

**Think in Arabic.** Whenever you have a few minutes, pick a random sentence and ask yourself, _how would I translate that into Arabic?_ A similar technique&#8211;throughout the day, when people are speaking around you, **randomly translate parts of their discussion** into Arabic. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you can&#8217;t translate all the words, or you lose some of the meaning&#8211;that act of thinking actually _increases_ your understanding. And it doesn&#8217;t take too much effort, either!

<div class="miniTitle">
  Write
</div>

**Write in Arabic, even if only a little.** A sentence or two here or there, maybe a couple of noun-verb-adjective-modifier sentences, whatever you like! Because writing is an important part of learning.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Fuse
</div>

Fuse these techniques together! <span class="gem">If you travel on the bus, by car, or walk for 30 or more minutes per day, spend your time thinking up a short Arabic story and write it out when you get a chance!</span>

It doesn&#8217;t have to be an amazing, inspiring, and life-changing epic of the battle between good and evil. You can write about some guy who owned a small duck that lives beside the masjid. Or two students who discover they have the same teacher. Or a foreign student explaining about his family overseas. **The content doesn&#8217;t matter&#8211;what does is the act of thinking and writing.**

Wallahu &#8216;alim. You may find that these small steps, performed occasionally (or, better yet, consistently) yield _surprisingly large results_.

May Allah grant us all amazing understanding of this beautiful and eloquant language of the Qur&#8217;an, ameen!
