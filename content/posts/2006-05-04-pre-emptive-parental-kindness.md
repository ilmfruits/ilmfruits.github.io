  Kindness to parents is pre-emptive&#8211;you fulfill their needs and wants before they can ask, before they even know it themselves.
</p>

Kindness to parents is pre-emptive&#8211;it means you fulfill their needs _before_ they ask. It&#8217;s not antagonistic, where they ask and ask and ask until you give in and do what they say. It&#8217;s not passive, where they have to tell you every little thing they need. It&#8217;s **active**, so take the **initiative** and do what needs to be done, in order to earn the pleasure of Allah.

So if you see a big pile of dishes in the sink, or your laundry-basket bulges with fullness, _act on them before they ask_. Be proactive with household chores and in fulfilling the rights of your parents. (Even if they didn&#8217;t ask you to do these things, how can they be anything but delighted if you do them without being asked?)
  
And of course, kindness to parents is **<dfn title="obligatory: performance results in reward, negligance may result in a punishment">fard</dfn>** (and therefore, punishable if one is negligant), and it&#8217;s one of their rights in Islam. After all, in the Qur&#8217;an, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حُسْنًا وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ لِتُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** We have enjoined on humankind kindness to parents: but if they (either of them) strive (to force) you to join with Me (in worship) anything of which you have no knowledge, obey them not. ([Surah Ankabut][1], verse 8)<sup>1</sup>

Also, a hadith from Sahih Bukhari:

> A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked for the fourth time, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father. &#8221; [[Bukhari 8/73/2][2]]<sup>2</sup>

May Allah give us all the tawfiq to fulfill all the obligations placed on us in Islam, ameen!
