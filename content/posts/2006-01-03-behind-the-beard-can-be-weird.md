  &#8220;Don&#8217;t judge a book by its cover or a man by his beard, because what&#8217;s behind the beard can be weird.&#8221;

Apply this to your lives, and you&#8217;ll find that, _bi ithnillah_ (by the permission of Allah), you will never be surprised or dissapointed. When you make great assumptions about people, where can they go except down?

Great assumptions often lead to great letdowns. Wallahu &#8216;alim.
