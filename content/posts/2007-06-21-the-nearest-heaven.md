Space: a black, velvety landscape. It stretches infinitely in every direction, a perfect paradox, an unconquered unknown. Stars, hundreds of thousands of stars—their light usually dimmed by the effects of pollution, electric lights, and daylight—glimmer like a quilt of fireflies, shimmering and twinkling.

Even the space itself shimmers and dances with colour—here, a blue nebulae with ghostly-transparent particles. There, a shimmering cascade of yellows and browns and pinks and reds that dance and weave their way through space.
  
And the stars—so many types of stars!&#8211;white dwarves, their light now gone, like dim diamonds; red dwarfs, like small garnets; black holes, like great, vacuous spaces; a small, pale reflective white orb of a moon; and the crown, the Lamp, the sun, a brilliant golden-yellow burst of light and heat and warmth.

The planets themselves lay like beads on a necklace, aligned and strung-together one moment then each twirling in their own orbit the next. Jupiter, a great big red ball, like a bouncy kids rubber-ball, with its centuries-old, perpetual Earth-sized storm; Pluto, a cold ball of dead ice; and of course, Earth, a blue marble warmed with oceans of water, green-sized fields, mountains, and of course, people.

All this, a gift from Allah (سبحانه وتعال) , to the people:

<div class="quran">
  وَلَقَدْ <strong>زَيَّنَّا السَّمَاء الدُّنْيَا</strong> بِمَصَابِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَاهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَاطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِي
</div>

**Translation:** And indeed We have **adorned the nearest heaven** with lamps, and We have made such lamps missiles to drive away the Shayateen, and prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire. [Surah Mulk, verse 5]

If this is the nearest heaven, what about the higher heavens?
