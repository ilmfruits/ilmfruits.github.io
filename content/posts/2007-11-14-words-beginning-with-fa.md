Bismillah.

Learning Arabic as a second language may be difficult for many, so I decided to share some tips that assist with learning the meanings of words and their structures.

<span class="gem">Words that begin with ف usually will always mean something that breaks open, separates, or breaks apart</span>. Check out these examples:

الفجر (Al-Fajr) from ف ج ر means the dawn, but it literally means when the daylight **breaks**/crack through the darkness. If you&#8217;ve ever seen the sky at Fajr time, you can see a thread of light near the horizon, while the rest of the sky is dark with the night. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) tells us in Surah Baqarah to stop eating suhoor when the &#8220;white thread&#8221; is distinguishable from the &#8220;black thread.&#8221;

Another word from this root is fajjara, with a shadda on the jeem, which means to **break** open and gush forth. Another word from this root is الفاجر (Al-Faajir), the fujjar (plural of faajir) cross the limits and **breaks** the rules.

الفرقان (Al-Furqaan) derives from ف ر ق, which means to **break** through, to distinguish. Al-Furqan, which is another name of the Qur&#8217;an, means the Criterion that distinguishes truth from falsehood.

الفريق (Al-Fareeq) also from ف ر ق means a party or a group. A group is one that **breaks** off from the majority.

الفاسقون (Al-Faasiqoon) from ف س ق and fisq, literally means when a flower **breaks** through the bud to bloom. The Fasiqoon are those who transgress the bounds of Allah, and go beyond them.

الفضة (Al-Fiddah) from ف ض ض, which means silver, but literally means to scatter. When you scatter something, the first thing you do is **break** it apart then you throw it all over the place. What does this have to do with silver? Silver is &#8216;scattered&#8217; when zakah is paid on it and when someone spends it. And after someone dies, their silver is &#8216;scattered&#8217; to the heirs.

InshaAllah try and look through the Qur&#8217;an for words beginning with ف that follow this pattern and post them in the comments! (You may need a dictionary, such as [this one][1].)

Wa lillahil hamd.
