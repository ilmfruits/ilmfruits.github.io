How does it feel after reading Qur&#8217;an? Does it make a difference in _us_? How much do we implement it regularly, or even within the same day of reading an ayah?

When learning from the Qur&#8217;an and the seerah of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), Allah mentions a believers qualities in the Qur&#8217;an. The believers hearts become fearful and their eyes tear. This is a sign of the true believers, as Allah describes them in the Qur&#8217;an:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَاناً وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ<br /> الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلاَةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ<br /> أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ حَقّاً لَّهُمْ دَرَجَاتٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ
</div>

**Translation:** &#8220;The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His verses are recited unto them, they increase their faith, and they put their trust in their Lord (alone), who perform the prayers and spend out of that which We have bestowed upon them. It is they who are truly the believers. For them are grades of dignity and a generous provision&#8221; (al-Anfaal 2-4).

<div class="quran">
  اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَاباً مُّتَشَابِهاً مَّثَانِيَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ
</div>

**Translation:** &#8220;Allah sent down the best speech, a Book, its parts resembling each other and oft-repeated. The skins of those who fear their lord shiver from it. Then their skins and their hearts soften to the remembrance of Allah&#8221; (al-Zumar 23).

We should all try to compare ourselves to the description of the believers Allah mentions in Qur&#8217;an. Do we fear Allah when we recite or hear the Qur&#8217;an? Does it affect our hearts? Do we cry thinking about what we have done and how we will be able to meet Allah in the Hereafter? These verses give us some _clear_ signs of being a true believer. These characteristics should occur within us at least sometimes. If they never do, then we must improve our eman and seek guidance from Allah!

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) help us reflect upon these verses as a true believer would (ameen)!
