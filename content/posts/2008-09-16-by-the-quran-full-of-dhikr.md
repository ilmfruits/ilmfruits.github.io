Bismillah

In one of the most beautiful beginnings of the Qur&#8217;an, Allah ta&#8217;ala starts surah Saad with a powerful reminder. He says:

<span style="font-size: x-large;">ص<span class="sign"> ۚ</span> وَالْقُرْآنِ ذِي الذِّكْرِ</span>

Saad. And by the Qur&#8217;an, full of dhikr! [Surah Saad, verse 1]

This ayah begins with a letter, which are known as: huroof muqatta&#8217;aat, the disjointed letters. There are many opinions as to what these letters mean, but the greatest and strongest opinion is that none but Allah ta&#8217;ala knows their meanings. But why do some surahs start with these letters, if no one knows the meaning? One reason is that it is for emphasis, and astonishment: here are letters from your own language, yet you cannot produce anything similar to it!

So this surah, with the first letter, has already set the tone with a powerful beginning. Then Allah ta&#8217;ala says: &#8220;and by the Qur&#8217;an, full of dhikr!&#8221; If you notice the letter &#8216;wow&#8217;, it shows that Allah is swearing and taking an oath by the Qur&#8217;an which is called a &#8216;qasm&#8217; in Arabic, which is why the translation is &#8220;and by&#8221;.

What is this Qur&#8217;an? <span style="font-size: x-large;">ذِي الذِّكْرِ</span>dhi dhikr, full of dhikr. the word &#8216;dhi&#8217; means possessor, one that contains, one that owns something. So what does the Qur&#8217;an own, contain and possess? adh-Dhikr. This is one of the names of the Qur&#8217;an, and gives multiple interpretations. There is a reason why this word has not be translated yet in this post, it is because this word in this context has several meanings:

  1. Firstly, dhikr here means &#8220;tadhkeer&#8221; (تذكير), a reminder. What does the Qur&#8217;an remind of? It reminds us of reality of life and of our duties and obligations.
  2. Secondly, dhikr here means &#8220;maw&#8217;idhah&#8221; (موعظة), admonition. A maw&#8217;idhah is an advice or instruction, but not just any advice, this advice is _effective and_ pushes a person to do good deeds and to abstain from disobedience.
  3. Thirdly, dhikr here means a bayyaan (بيان) &#8216;a mention, explanation&#8217;. What does the Qur&#8217;an mention? The nations of the past, ahkaam (rulings) and future events as well.
  4. Lastly, dhikr here means sharaf (شرف), honor. The Qur&#8217;an, by its mention, is a source of honor for those who accept. The one who mentions the Qur&#8217;an is honored as well as the Qur&#8217;an itself is honorable.

So this Qur&#8217;an is dhi dhikr: possessor and owner of reminder, admonition, advice and honor. SubhanAllah, **absolute** completeness. This ayah is a response to the pagans of Makkah who said, we wish we had a dhikr from the former people! Allah responds, _this_ is the Qur&#8217;an, dhi dhikr.

Have you sought out the dhikr today? May Allah ta&#8217;ala make us companions of the Qur&#8217;an, Ameen.

and Allah ta&#8217;ala knows best.
