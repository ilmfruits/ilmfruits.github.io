  Human Nature is Insatiable
</div>

Human nature is insatiable. No matter how much you get, you will never be happy with it. That is the way we have been created. <span class="gem">The key to happiness is not to get it all, but rather, to be content with little</span>.

&#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from incapacity, from sloth, from cowardice, from miserliness, from decrepitude, and from the torment of the grave. O Allah, grant to my soul the sense of righteousness and purify it, for Thou art the Best Purifier thereof. Thou art the Protecting Friend thereof, and Guardian thereof. O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from the knowledge which does not benefit, from the heart that does not entertain the fear (of Allah), from the soul that does not feel contented, and the supplication that is not responded to.&#8221; [[Muslim Book 035, Number 6568][1]]

Psychological studies indicate that those who win the lottery, after they get this money, report an increased amount of happiness&#8211;but this happiness is short lived! Soon, even with their extra money, they return to the same level of happiness as before they had this money. But how can this be? Wouldn&#8217;t they be happier? You would be surprised that the answer is no.

Even when it comes to the desire for the opposite sex, superstars like Napoleon (who later accepted Islam and [shared his story][2]) who had all the money, could have had all the women he wanted, do you think they had happiness without Islam? No. Napoleon said that all the money he had <span class="gem">was not even a tiny bit of happiness compared to the happiness he has now that he found Deen ul-Islam</span>. In fact, his life, and many others, lived a life of misery. The more you have, the more you will want.

Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If Adam&#8217;s son had a valley full of gold, he would like to have two valleys, for nothing fills his mouth except dust. And Allah forgives him who repents to Him.&#8221; [[Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 76, Number 447][3]]

And also, Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Riches does not mean having a great amount of property, but riches are self-contentment.&#8221; [[Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 76, Number 453][3]]

Money is a reflection or a multiplier of what is inside your heart. If what is inside your heart is good, then the money can multiply that good, but if what is in your heart is bad, the money will multiply that evil. The key is not to be attached to it and not to desire it.

Narrated Hakim bin Hizam: I asked the Prophet (for some money) and he gave me some, and then again I asked him and he gave me some, and then again I asked him and he gave me some, and he then said, &#8220;This wealth is (like) green and sweet (fruit), and whoever takes it without greed, Allah will bless it for him, but whoever takes it with greed, Allah will not bless it for him, and he will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied. And the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (taking) hand.&#8221; [[Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 76, Number 448][4]]

And Allah knows best.
