  Happiness lies in rememberence of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and His blessings. It keeps you happy.
</p>

One guy performed Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) once, and complained about the crush of the crowd. But would you be happy if you were _the only Muslim there?_ No way. You&#8217;d hate it. So remember the blessings even when Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) tests you with difficult tests.

**Tip:** When you say <span class="foreignWord">Al-Hamdullilah</span>, mean it. Think about a specific blessing Allah blessed you with. InshaAllah you will increase in your thankfullness and happiness.
