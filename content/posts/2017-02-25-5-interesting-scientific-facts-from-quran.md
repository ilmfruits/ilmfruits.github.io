Islam as a religion brings an answer to every single question that exists; this is why it is considered as the <a href="http://quranacademy.io/blog/after-reading-chapter-21-of-the-quran-my-life-changed-for-the-most-unexpected-reason/" target="_blank"><strong>complete code of life</strong></a>. You can find the impressions of Islam in each part of a Muslim life, regardless of whether it is some financial issue, social, personal or any other thing related to life.

Among the different variables, something which makes Islam the top religion in the case of the contemporary existence of today&#8217;s reality is the way that it is in total reverberation with the modern science that is a primitive instrument for the general population nowadays to judge anything.

There are many verses that are written in the Quran are proven facts of the modern science. The best part of it is that Quran came into the world thousands of years ago and it contains all the practical realities of today’s world. Here are the five interest scientific facts that you can find in the Quran:

  1.  **Use of water in life**

Quran: **“We made every living thing from water. Will they not believe?”** (21:30)

This verse indicates that water is the primary element used in the construction of everything. Science has now proved that every single living thing is made of water, cells and cell bodies and not to forget that they contain more than 80% water.

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <strong> Iron as another important existing thing</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

As the general population nowadays we know that iron is one of the metals that can be found on this planet. Be that as it may, the researchers have come to locate the first wellspring of iron according to which iron is basically originated from the space, and it is not an ordinary metal of the earth. In this regard, you will find written in the Holy Quran:

Quran: **“We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war, as well as many benefits for mankind.”** (57:25)

This verse shows us that iron is that one metal which is sent by Allah so clearly it does not belong to this planet.

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <strong> Sky is a protection for us</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Quran: **“We made the sky a protective ceiling. And yet they are turning away from Our signs!”** (21:32)

In the above-written verse, Allah notices the sky as a defensive roof for individuals. It wasn&#8217;t clear to the general population of that time; notwithstanding, individuals of today&#8217;s world who have admittance to the modern science can concur with the way that the sky really serves as a defensive shield for life that exists on the earth.

And in today’s date, the science proofs the fact that the sky actually protects the planet from all those substances that are considered harmful to life on earth.

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <strong>Mountains as mentioned in the Quran </strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Quran: **“Did We not make the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?”** (78:6-7)

In this verse, it is stated in a very obvious way that mountains are very similar to the stakes which are not just on the surface of the earth but are fixed in the real depth. And this is now proven by the modern science as well.

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <strong>Creation of the universe</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Quran: **“And it is We who have built the Universe with (Our creative) power and keep expanding it.”** (51:47)

This verse clearly states the fact that universe is all created by Allah the Almighty and you can see written in the verse that the universe keeps growing as the time is passing, it is not what is was when it was created so yes, it is constantly changing with the time. And the modern science has now proved this fact that the universe is something really not stagnant, it is expanding and growing with time.

All these verses are from the Quran and are now scientific facts as well!
