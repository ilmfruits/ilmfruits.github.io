During the time of &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), Amr ibn al-&#8216;As was in Egypt, and requested fighters. &#8216;Umar (radiallahu &#8216;an) sent a letter saying &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you 8000 fighters.&#8221; He sent 4000 fighters. &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;As (radiallahu &#8216;an) replied and said (to the meaning of) &#8220;you said you sent 8000 and you sent 4000,&#8221; and &#8216;Umar (radiallahu &#8216;an) said &#8220;I sent 4000, and at the head of each thousand is a man worth 1000 himself.

Az-Zubayr (radiallahu &#8216;an) was one of those men worth 1000.

In the battle of Yarmuk, where the Muslims fought 100 000+ Roman soldiers, Az-Zubayr fought the army himself. This incident is in Sahih Bukhari.

To encourage the Muslims, he stood in front of them and said &#8220;who will pledge to go and fight to the death?&#8221; so a group stepped forward, and they&#8217;d go and fight.

They&#8217;d all be martyred, may Allah be pleased with them all. Then he&#8217;d come back and say the same thing again&#8211;&#8220;who will pledge to fight to the death?&#8221; so a smaller group stepped forward, and they&#8217;d go and fight, and only he would return.

This happened a few times. Although his goal was to uplift spirits, the Muslimeen became dejected&#8211;like &#8220;anyone who goes with him will die&#8221;.

So when nobody stepped forward, he turned to his son Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) and said &#8220;Ok, if nobody&#8217;s going, let&#8217;s _you and me go. And fight the entire army. By ourselves.&#8221;_ (Abdullah was about 13&#8211;so this would be like his eight-grade field-trip &#8230;)

So Abdullah (radiallahu &#8216;an) led the horse, and they went into the Roman army and fought.

They **took on the entire army themselves** and cut **directly into the army**, like through the middle. Az-Zubayr (radiallahu &#8216;an) fought Roman warriors **in 360 degrees**.

They cut through, into the middlle&#8211;the most intense part of the army&#8211;then out the back.

And then to get back to the Muslims, instead of going around, they went **back through the middle again**, fought the Romans 360 degrees, all the way through the army, back to where they started from.

A great deal of time had passed&#8211;so much so that the Muslims thought they were dead. But then, they returned.

One of the companions (may Allah be pleased with them) said &#8220;ma awwan ar-Room&#8221; (how weak the Romans). And then the Muslims fought and defeated the Roman army.
