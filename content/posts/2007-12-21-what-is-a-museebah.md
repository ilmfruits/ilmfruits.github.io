    Allah says in the Qur'an that He will surely test us in this world with disasters. By studying the linguistic meaning of "Museebah" (disaster) we can understand the connection disasters have with Allah's Decree. 'Museebah' is from the letters saad-waw-ba, and it literally means when an arrow hits its target. From this we extract that misfortunes are deliberately planned and not by chance. These misfortunes were written for us, and they will surely come to pass.

Bismillah.

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in Surah Al-Baqarah:

<div class="quran">
  وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الأَمْوَالِ وَالأنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ<br /> الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُواْ إِنَّا لِلّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعونَ
</div>

**Translation:** And We shall surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient. Those who when disaster strikes them, say, &#8220;Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we will return. [Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 155-156]

These ayaat are very beautiful, and we learn from them that we will all be tested in this life, each person in their own individual way.

Let&#8217;s look specifically at the word &#8220;museebah.&#8221; The root word is from saad-waw-ba, or &#8220;saub&#8221;. The Arabs used the word &#8220;saub&#8221; to refer to when the arrow hit its target. This alludes to the fact that the act was intentional, deliberate, and not by chance. How does this connect with a disaster striking us?

SubhanAllah, a museebah reaches its target; it was **meant** to happen. Allah&#8217;s Decree WILL come to pass. So instead of complaining and sulking, and asking questions like &#8220;WHY ME?!&#8221;, remember this ayah the next time a test comes your way &#8230; the arrow is merely hitting its target.

Then Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, &#8220;wa bashir as-Sabireen,&#8221; which means &#8220;and give good tidings to the patient.&#8221; The word &#8220;bashir&#8221; is from ba-sheen-raa and it literally means skin or human; from this, we derive the meaning. &#8220;Bashir&#8221; means happiness, happiness that causes a reaction on the skin, either with goosebumps or smiling, and the like.

So these patient ones (may Allah make us among them) will grin from ear to ear when they receive these glad tidings. What are the glad tidings? Al-Jannah. <span class="gem">They get Jannah in return for their patience.</span>

So do not despair with what afflicts and will afflict you; the arrow will hit its target, and the One who granted Umm Salamah (رضالله عنها) a blessed position after her calamity can grant you something better than what you are going through. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will definately reward you if you show patience (remember, at the first stroke of calamity).

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) pour patience on us and make us among the muttaqeen. Ameen!

Walhamdulillahi rabbil alamin.
