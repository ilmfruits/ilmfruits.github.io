Bismillah,

Ramadan is of a countable number of days, so we have to be smart, and think about how can we MAXIMIZE the rewards we earn! Inshallah following is a list of ibada that take less time and have big reward. We need to be smart and think like a businessman (small investment -> big profit)

Remember reward of every deed is multiplied in Ramadan.

  * [Get the reward of hajj and umrah every single day][1]
  * [Be smart in your dhikar][2]
  * [Get the reward of fasting many Ramadans][3]
  * [Get the reward of performing salaah the whole night][4]
  * Earn the reward of reciting one third of Qur&#8217;an in few minutes:
  
    Imam Muslim (811) narrated from Abu Darda that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Is any one of you unable to recite one-third of the Qur&#8217;an in one night?&#8221; They said, &#8220;How could anyone read one-third of the Qur&#8217;an?&#8221; He said, <span class="gem">&#8220;Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad (i.e. Surah Ikhlaas) is equivalent to one-third of the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;</span> [[more][5]]
  * Fulfill various ibadah activities whenever you can&#8211;if you get a few minutes here or there, just pick one and do it! You can find a full checklist [here][6]. 
      * Create chain reaction:
  
        Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم) as saying: He who called (people) to righteousness, <span class="gem">there would be reward (assured) for him like the rewards of those who adhered to it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect</span>. And he who called (people) to error, he shall have to carry (the burden) of its sin, like those who committed it, without their sins being diminished in any respect.[Shaih Muslim Book 034, The Book of Knowledge]</ul> 
    <p align="center">
      Just pass on the hadith we just learned to 10 people, and you will get the reward of 10 hajj and umrah in a single day! Think of it as a chain reaction, every time someone learns something from you and acts upon it, you get the same reward! Fusion reaction!
    </p>

      May Allah(سبحانه وتعالى) give us the tawfiq to implement what was learned and to gain full benefit out of this Ramadan Inshallah.
