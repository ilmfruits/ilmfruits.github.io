During a year of difficulty&#8211;during the reign of Abu Bakr as-Siddique (radiAllahu &#8216;an), when the Muslims needed food&#8211;this HUGE caravan rolls into town. Everyone clamers around, they want to buy stuff, and it goes straight to the house of &#8216;Uthman (radiAllahu &#8216;an). He owned the caravans.

So they went to &#8216;Uthman and said &#8220;We want to buy it from you, we&#8217;ll give you **double** the price&#8221;&#8211;that is, double the cost, for food. They needed it _that_ much. Subhanallah.

&#8216;Uthman (radiAllahu &#8216;an) said &#8220;I can get a better deal then that.&#8221;

They said &#8220;we&#8217;ll give you **triple** the price&#8221;.

&#8216;Uthman (radiAllahu &#8216;an) said &#8220;I can get a better deal then that.&#8221;

They&#8217;re like ohhh man. &#8220;We&#8217;ll give you **quadruple** the price&#8221;, like 300% pure profit. For every dollar he spent, he&#8217;d get four.

&#8216;Uthman (radiAllahu &#8216;an) said &#8220;Can you give me a better price then **ten to one**?&#8221;

&#8230;

And that&#8217;s when they realized what he was talking about: _Doing business with Allah._ <span class="gem">When you do business with Allah, the profit is ten to one.</span>

Then &#8216;Uthman (radiAllahu &#8216;an) **gave away the caravan as charity**. He said &#8220;take the whole caravan, I&#8217;ve donated it for the sake of Allah.&#8221;

Subhanallah. That was the generosity of &#8216;Uthman (radiAllahu &#8216;an). And it didn&#8217;t cripple him financially to do that&#8211;he did similar things _over and over and over_.

How? The answer to that is coming soon inshaAllah!
