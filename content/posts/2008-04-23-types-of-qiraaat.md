excerpt: "Qira'aat: recitations.  Like other sciences, qira'aat is part of the sciences of the Qur'an.  So what types of qira'aat exist?  There are saheeh (authentic), shaadh, da'eef (weak--like da'eef hadith) and baatil (forged qira'aat).  Of the saheeh, there are ten qira'aat; of the shaadh, there are four.  You can't recite shaadh qira'aat in salaah, but you can still study them in Muslim institutions of higher learning."

Qira&#8217;aat. Recitations. Like other parts of Islam, Qira&#8217;aat have been codified&#8211;it&#8217;s a science, just like the science of hadith.

And, just like ahadith, qira&#8217;aat have different types. What kind of types? Four types, actually:

  1. **Saheeh:** Authentic qira&#8217;aat. To be saheeh, a qira&#8217;ah must have an authentic chain of narration back to the Prophet (S), and it must conform with the Uthmanic mushaf. There are ten of these puppies&#8211;not seven, as is the common misconception.
  2. **Shaadh:** These qira&#8217;aat have an authentic chain of narration back to the Prophet (S), _but_ they don&#8217;t fit into the Uthmanic mushaf. **By consensus of the &#8216;ulama, you _cannot_ recite shaadh qira&#8217;aat in salaah.** Why are they considered so, if they have an authentic chain? Perhaps because of the importance of the second compilation of the Qur&#8217;an. The sahaba made ijmaa, and we have to respect it.
  3. **Da&#8217;eef:** weak. These qira&#8217;aat don&#8217;t have an authentic chain of narrators, but a broken chain.
  4. **Baatil:** these are qira&#8217;aat that others invented. (Yes, people forge qira&#8217;aat, just like they forge ahadith. It&#8217;s disgusting, I know.)

Which are these ten qira&#8217;aat that are authentic? That&#8217;s another topic for another post!

Oh, and shaadh qira&#8217;aat? You can still study them that higher institutions of Islamic learning. A few people study in the faculty of Qur&#8217;an and memorize all ten qira&#8217;aat&#8211;and fewer still study the four shaadh.
