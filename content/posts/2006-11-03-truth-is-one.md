  Truth is one and falsehood is many.
</p>

How do we know? Just look at the Qur&#8217;an! Allah makes a simile of truth as a _singular_ light (noor), and falsehood as a _plural_ of darkness (dhulumaat &#8212; multiple).

What&#8217;s more, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) once drew a stick in the dirt and said &#8220;this is _the_ Straight Path.&#8221; He then drew lines that grew away from it, left and right, and said &#8220;these are the _paths_ of misguidance, and at the top of every one of these paths is a devil calling the people.&#8221;

The point is, the path to Allah is one&#8211;siratal mustaqin. There are not different versions of Islam&#8211;1.0, 1.1, 2.0, nope. There is _one_.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) keep us all on the straight path, ameen!
