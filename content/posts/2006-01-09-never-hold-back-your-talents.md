<p class="gem">
  If you possess some skill you can utilize to the benefit of the people everywhere, never hold back. Don&#8217;t hold it to yourself. Forget about what other people are thinking. Focus on how they can benefit from it.

This applies especially if a) you have relatively rare talents, or b) nobody knows about your skills.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
