The purpose of life is to worship Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and dua is the crux of worship. 

[Dua: The Weapon of the Believer Video][1]

Dua: Goes hand-in-hand with tawakkul (trust and hope in Allah (سبحانه وتعالى))

Dua is the essence of worship: calling to The One, the Only One who can actually help you and Who actually deserves to be called upon. The One who is As-Samad, The Satisfier of every need; upon Whom everything depends but He depends on no one and nothing. Dua is calling upon the Creator, the Sustainer, the Supreme Answerer. [Calling out to other than Allah is the essence of shirk]

<div class="quran">
  وَقَالَ رَبُّڪُمُ ٱدۡعُونِىٓ أَسۡتَجِبۡ لَكُمۡۚ
</div>

**Translation:** And your Lord says: Pray unto me: and I will hear your prayer. [Suratal-Ghafir, verse 60]

Dua is a very personal form of worship; we call directly The One, our Creator, our Sustainer, Al-Mujeeb: the Answerer. And when we call upon Him privately, and sincerely, and full of humility, it becomes a sincere form of worship.

<div class="quran">
  ٱدۡعُواْ رَبَّكُمۡ تَضَرُّعً۬ا وَخُفۡيَةًۚ
</div>

**Translation:** Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret! [Suratal Araf, verse 55]

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is indeed near. He hears our call even when we pray silently. He sees every tear that crawls down our cheeks, and hears every whisper that emerges from our lips as we call to Him (سبحانه وتعالى) for mercy and help. It is of the etiquettes of dua to pray silently, for Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is Al-Sami, the All-Hearer and He is near.

<div class="quran">
  وَ إِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌۖ أُجِيبُ دَعۡوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِۖ
</div>

**Translation:** When My servants ask you concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them); I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calls on Me. [Suratul Baqarah, verse 186]

The dua of a believer is accepted!! SubhanAllah, look at Allah&#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) mercy! He (سبحانه وتعالى) provided us with a way out of everything, with a solution to all wants and needs, DUA! A direct link to the source of all solutions. Truly, all praise is due to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). 

When we make dua we affirm the Greatness of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). We affirm our status of being Allah&#8217;s (سبحانه وتعالى) slaves and being dependent on Him (سبحانه وتعالى) for everything.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grant us the tawfeeq to turn to Him (سبحانه وتعالى) in times of ease and in times of hardship in gratitude, ameen!
