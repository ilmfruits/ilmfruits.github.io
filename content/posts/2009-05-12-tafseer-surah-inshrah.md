**Note:** this is our 13th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/flower-erupts-through-concrete.jpg" alt="flower-erupts-through-concrete" title="flower-erupts-through-concrete" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1141" />
  
<span class="imageCaption">Stand up and do more. Muslims don&#8217;t retire or quit from working for the deen. Persist. Be like the flower that springs through concrete.</span>

Allah says, in verse 3:

> وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ

**Translation:** And raised high for you your repute.

If you see those polls on CNN and BBC and all those places, &#8220;Who is the most famous person in the world?&#8221; And all those emails go out, &#8220;vote for the Prophet,&#8221; &#8220;vote for the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Indeed, he IS (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) the most famous person world-wide; the one who had the biggest influence. Even non-Muslims know it; perhaps that is why Muhammad is the most-common name in the world.

One scholar mentioned, that this also applies to the sahaba&#8211;like Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthman, and &#8216;Ali, radiallahu anhum ajmaeen. Like the example of &#8216;Ali&#8211;he is one of the companions who is known world-wide; and yet, his father Abu Talib, the only reason we know him is because of his son. In this way, Allah has raised the names of these people, and others like them, throughout time; while there are millions of other Muslims who lived and died, and nobody even knows their names.

Allah says, in Surah Inshrah, verse 7:

> فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَانصَبْ

**Translation:** So when you have finished [your duties], then stand up [for worship]. [Surah Inshrah, verse 7]

This ayah alludes to a deep point&#8211;that there really isn&#8217;t an ending to the work, until you die. When a project ends, when the time to move on appears, Allah says: stand up.

This happens when people transition from highschool MSA to university, or from university MSA to work-world; they say &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my duty for 1-3 years, I&#8217;m done here.&#8221; Stand up, and keep going.

Or you might see people working on an Islamic project&#8211;maybe a halaqah they&#8217;ve run for the last two years; or a blog they&#8217;ve maintained for the last six months; or a dinner or event they&#8217;ve been planning for the last year.

Don&#8217;t stop! Keep going! Find another project to do, another door to open, if necessary.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.

**Action Items:**

  * **Stand Up.** Did you do more for Islam in the past than you did now? Are you at a low-point? Find something small and consistent you can do; or find another way to make your existing work Islamic&#8211;for example, intending to continue your studies in university so you can work to earn halal rizq for your family. Or if you&#8217;re graduated, intending to earn halal rizq to support yourself and your family.
  * **Keep Going.** Is there some project that you just completed? Take a day or two to rest, and start another one! Let the momentum drive you to better and quicker results, insha&#8217;Allah.
