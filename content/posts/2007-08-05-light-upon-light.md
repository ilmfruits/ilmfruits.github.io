[Light Upon Light: Fundamentals of Faith 102][1] is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Yasir Qadhi.

_Allah._ The name conjures up many associations&#8211;the Creator, the Sustainer, the only one to be worshipped. The All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing. Ar-Rahmaan, Ar-Raheem.

But who is Allah? Do we _really_ know Allah (سبحانه وتعال), in all His majesty and glory and might and mercy? Or&#8211;like so many of the Muslims today&#8211;do we only claim to know Allah, while in fact, we know almost nothing about Him&#8211;the one who sent the Prophets as a mercy to us, who created us for nothing but His worship, out of His mercy!

Learn about Allah, Al-Ahad, Ar-Rahmaan, the one who we devote our lives to, from authentic understandings that date back to the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) himself. Learn the science of knowing Allah, His Names and Attributes, and about the different ways groups deviated in their &#8216;aqeedah.

And Allah (سبحانه وتعال) says in Suratul A&#8217;raaf:

<div class="quran">
  وَلِلّهِ الأَسْمَاء الْحُسْنَى فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا <strong>وَذَرُواْ الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَآئِهِ</strong> سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ
</div>

Translation:

To Allah belong the most beautiful names, so call him with those names. And **leave those who have deviated with regards to his names.** They will be requited for what they used to do. [Suratul A&#8217;raaf, verse 180]
