  Anytime Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), or the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) mention Paradise for an action, it means that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) holds that action in high regard. So perform these activities regularly, and with ihsaan!
</p>

Inshallah in the coming days, we will expound and narrate some instances where Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), or His messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم), promised paradise &#8212; keys that we can use to unlock the doors and, inshallah, enter!

And remember, for your action to be accepted inshallah, you need **_sincerity_**&#8211;because all actions are based on intentions, and you get the reward for what you intended!

**Keys to Paradise:**
