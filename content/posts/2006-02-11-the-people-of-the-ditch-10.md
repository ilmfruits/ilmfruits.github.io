The king&#8217;s companion returned to the king. They knew he was cured&#8211;previously, people had to help him find his way in, but now, he waltzed right in.

The king said: &#8220;Who gave you back your sight?&#8221;

His companion said: &#8220;My Lord.&#8221;

The king said: &#8220;Do you have a Lord other then me?&#8221;

His companion said: &#8220;My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221;

So the king tortured him until he pointed out the boy.

With kings and tyrannical rulers, loyalty isn&#8217;t even a word in their dictionary. They use people so long as it benefits them, and discard them.

Think about it. This was **the king&#8217;s man**, his close companion from who-knows-when. And as soon as the guy ceased to be useful, the **king tortured him**. Subhanallah. This is why scholars say kings give you nothing for the dunya **except** that they take away something from your deen.

It happens all around us&#8211;like in France. You want a government subsidy? Then take off your hijab.

Here, we see an **extreme** example: you **keep your life** in the dunya, or **die with your deen**. <span class="gem">It&#8217;s <strong>always </strong>the same with oppressive rulers&#8211;they take something from the deen when they give you something.</span>

May Allah protect us from oppressive rulers.
