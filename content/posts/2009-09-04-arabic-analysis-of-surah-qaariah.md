This is post #31 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series).

As per the poll on our [twitter account][1], there was consensus on their being a post on grammatical analysis of Surah Qaari&#8217;ah. So here you go insha&#8217;Allah.

**Standard Disclaimer:** I am not an Arab (as in, fluent in Arabic) nor have I double-checked this in books of &#8216;ulama discussing grammar; there is sometimes difference of opinion in grammar, as well; so take it as such insha&#8217;Allah.

Let&#8217;s go word-by-word insha&#8217;Allah.

  * **Al-Qaari&#8217;ah (الْقَارِعَةُ):** (verse 1) Notice that it ends with ta-marbuwta, the little funny face-like letter. This means that _if you stop on that letter, it&#8217;s pronounced as a haa; and if you keep going, it&#8217;s pronounced as a taa._ So you can say &#8220;Al-Qaari&#8217;ah&#8221; or &#8220;Al-Qaariatu &#8230; [continuing on].&#8221; I know in Indo-Pak lands, they always pronounce it as a ta; but that&#8217;s not correct.
  * **Wa Maa Adaraaka Maa Al-Qaari&#8217;ah (وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْقَارِعَةُ):** (verse 3) This phrase occurs often enough in the Qur&#8217;an; let&#8217;s dissect it more insha&#8217;Allah.
  * **Wa (وَ):** And. Shortest word in the Arabic language!
  * **Maa (مَا):** Maa can have lots of meanings. Here, it&#8217;s ismu-istifhaam, aka the interrogative particle, aka the question-mark. In English, we put a question-mark at the end of a sentence; in Arabic, we use maa, or a (أ), or hal (هَل).
  * **Adraaka (أَدْرَاكَ):** Adraa is a verb; the maf&#8217;ool (recipient of the verb) is &#8220;ka,&#8221; which means &#8220;you&#8221; (singular, second-person, masculine). Even though it&#8217;s masculine, in Arabic, if you don&#8217;t know the person you&#8217;re speaking to, you can refer to them in the masculine gender, singular or plural. (Plural is more respectful.)
  * **Maa (مَا):** The second maa in this phrase is also ismu-istifhaam (the question-mark); if we just chopped the phrase before this word, we would get: maa Al-Qaariah? What is Al-Qaari&#8217;ah?
  * **Yawma (يَوْمَ):** Yawmun means &#8220;a day.&#8221; Al-Yawm, means the day. Yawma is definite (with single tanween&#8211;yawma, not yawman) but it eludes me why it&#8217;s definite and mansoob (with fatha). It looks like it might be mudaaf, but where&#8217;s the mudaaf ilayh?
  * **Yakuwnu (يَكُونُ):** (verse 4) Yakuwnu is the third-person, singular, masculine, present-tense form of kaana. Kaana means &#8220;he was,&#8221; and yakuwnu is &#8220;he is.&#8221; What does it refer to? See the next word.
  * **An-Naas (النَّاسُ):** An-Naas is an interesting word. It&#8217;s a singular word, but refers to a plural (humankind); some scholars say it comes from the root nasiya/yansaa, to forget&#8211;because human nature is to forget. Here, it&#8217;s marfoo&#8217; (with dumma: an-naas_u_) so we know it&#8217;s the faa&#8217;il (doer) of yakuwnu. By the way, **this is the norm in Arabic**&#8211;to put the verb before the doer, unlike in English.
  * **Ka (كَ):** Not &#8220;you,&#8221; but ka here is the particle of comparison&#8211;you can translate it as &#8220;is like&#8221; or &#8220;as like (the example of)&#8221; or something similar. The thing that it&#8217;s comparing to (eg. the &#8220;you&#8221; in &#8220;like you&#8221;) is always majroor (with kasra).
  * **Al-Faraash (الْفَرَاشِ):** Faraash means moths&#8211;those butterfly-like beings; see the picture at the top of the post. We know it&#8217;s the thing that An-Naas is compared to, because it&#8217;s majroor (with kasra).
  * **Al-Mabthooth (الْمَبْثُوثِ):** Scattered. Notice it has the same a) number, b) gender, c) case (kasra) and d) definitivity (alif-lam) as Al-Faraashi; this marks it as an adjective. Again, unlike English, in Arabic, the adjective comes after the word it describes.
  * **Takuwnu (تَكُونُ):** (verse 5) In Arabic, the mudaari&#8217; (present-tense verb) has the same form for &#8220;you&#8221; (masculine singular 2nd-person) and &#8220;she&#8221; (feminine singular 3rd-person). That form is&#8211;you guessed it&#8211;takuwnu. How do you know what it refers to? By the context, of course&#8211;this is why Arabs (as in, those fluent in Arabic) must _constantly apply their brains_ when reading, writing, speaking, and listening in (Classical/Fushaa) Arabic. It&#8217;s not like English!
  * **Al-Jibaalu (الْجِبَالُ):** That was easy. Al-Jibaal is the plural of jabal (mountain). It&#8217;s marfoo&#8217;, and it&#8217;s obviously the faa&#8217;il (because it&#8217;s marfoo&#8217; with damma). But wait a minute&#8211;we said takuwnu is for she and you. But Al-Jibaal is neither&#8211;it&#8217;s a masculine plural! What&#8217;s going on? The answer is, _Arabic treats the non-human plural as feminine singular._ [Read all about it at Arabic Tree][2] (if you&#8217;re interested). It&#8217;s complicated, I know. That&#8217;s why Al-Jibaal works with takuwnu.
  * **Ka Al-&#8216;ahni Al-Manfooshi:** Same structure as ka al-faraashi al-mabthooth.
  * **Fa (فَ):** Fa has a couple of meanings that I know of; one is to indicate something that happens _immediately_ after something else; the other meaning is the one used here&#8211;to section out a group into sections. Eg. if you have two people, Muhammad and Musa, you can say &#8220;fa Muhammad, he is a doctor; and fa Musa, he is a teacher.&#8221; Translated usually as &#8220;as for.&#8221; The rest of this verse gives you the section&#8211;the one who is heavy in deeds.
  * **Man (مَن):** Who. It&#8217;s ismu-istifhaam (question-mark&#8211;eg. &#8220;who are you?&#8221;) but not here. Man, since it means &#8220;who,&#8221; can also mean &#8220;anyone&#8221; or &#8220;the person who.&#8221;
  * Thaqulat (ثَقُلَتْ):</strong> Heavy. The commonly-used form is thaqeel.
  * Mawaaziynu (مَوَازِينُ):</strong> Mawaaziyn is the plural of mizaan. Mizaan is like a weighing scale with two ends that you can use to compare two things; mawaaziyn is plural. Al-Mizaan refers to the scale that will weigh our good and bad deeds on the Yawm-ul-Qaari&#8217;ah. Notice also it&#8217;s definite with single tanween (mawaazeen_u_), which is a hint it might be mudaaf (possessed object in a possessive case construct).
  * **Hu (هُ):** The mudaaf ilayh. Hu is the majroor/mansoob version of huwa; so together with mawaazeen, we get the translation &#8220;his scales.&#8221; And the &#8220;he&#8221; refers to &#8220;man&#8221; earlier in the verse.
  * **Fa (فَ):** (verse 7) This is the other meaning of fa&#8211;something that happens immediately after something else. Subhanallah it&#8217;s like the one who is heavy in his mawaazeen, fa huwa fiy &#8216;ishaat ar-raadi&#8217;a.
  * **Fiy (فِي):** In. Standard harf-ul-jarr, where&#8217;s the majroor?
  * **&#8216;Iyshatin (عِيشَةٍ):** It&#8217;s majroor because of fiy. It means life. It&#8217;s indefinite, so it means &#8220;a life.&#8221;
  * **Raadiyah (رَّاضِيَةٍ):** Pleasant. You can see the root verb&#8211;radiya, to be pleased with (as in: radiallahu &#8216;anhu, Allah is _pleased_ with them). Notice it&#8217;s the same a) number (singular) b) gender (feminine) c) case (majroor) d) definitivity (indefinite) as &#8216;ishaat&#8211;making it an adjective.
  * **Fa amma man khaffat mawaaziynuhu (وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ):** (verse 8) Exactly the same construct as verse 6; except Allah uses khaffat, light; the commonly-used word is khafeef.
  * **Fa ummuhu (فَأُمُّهُ):** (verse 9) Fa is the same particle of immediately-following as in verse 7. Ummun means a mother; Ummu is definite (single tanween), and it is, as you might guess, mudaaf; the mudaaf ilayhi is &#8220;hu.&#8221; Ummuhu, therefore, means &#8220;his mother.&#8221;
  * **Haawiyah (هَاوِيَةٌ):** An abyss. If you&#8217;re non-Arab like me, you might say, &#8220;what IS this haawiyah thing?&#8221;
  * **Wa maa adraaka maa hiya (وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا هِيَ):** Precisely the question posed in our minds. What _is_ haawiyah?
  * Naarun haamiyah (نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ):</strong> Naarun means &#8220;a fire.&#8221; Haamiyatun means, intensely hot; note that these two match in the number, gender, case, and (in)definitiveness; they are na&#8217;at and man&#8217;oot, the adjective case. This is, of course, a glimpse of what is haawiyah; as we mentioned in the tafseer, we can never know fully what it is.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala a&#8217;lam.
