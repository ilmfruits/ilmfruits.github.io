excerpt: Is it permissible to sell grapes? Of course! What about selling to a mom, who will eat them? What about to the owner of a wine factory? What about someone who MAY use them for halal or haram? We expound on this important principle of fiqh--the certainty principle--which answers this question precisely and completey.

**Edit:** It&#8217;s makrooh, NOT haram, to sell something when you&#8217;re 50%+ sure it&#8217;ll be used for haram.

In Islamic finance, permissibility to sell something is tempered by the **certainty principle**&#8211;that is, how certain are you that this thing you&#8217;re selling will be used properly?

Say you sell grapes in a specialty grape-only store. A few types of customers come in:

  * A young woman comes in with her little boy and buys some grapes; you see her feeding him the grapes as soon as the cashier scans it through. Is it permissible to sell her grapes? Absolutely. It&#8217;s **halal**.
  * A young executive comes in; you see &#8220;Wines R Us&#8221; embroidered on his jacket. He asks you, the owner, about the quality of different grapes you sell, and mentions that he needs sour grapes for a certain type of wine. Is it permissible to sell him the grapes? **Absolutely not. It&#8217;s haram.** Because it becomes the means of haram.
  * A man comes in looking to buy grapes. You _think_ that he _might_ be making wine with it. But you&#8217;re not sure. What&#8217;s the ruling? **It depends on how certain you are.** </ul> 
    The ruling is that **if you are 50% certain (or more) that something will be used for haram, it&#8217;s makrooh (maybe super-duper-uber makrooh) to sell it.** Once you reach 100% certainty that it will be used for haram, it becomes haram to sell it.
    
    What&#8217;s the proof of this principle? The hadith in Bukhari. A man came and asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), what do I do if I think I broke my wudoo? The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, if you hear it or smell it, THEN act on it.
    
    Is it possible you broke it, but without noise or maybe without smell? Yes! There&#8217;s a possibility! But are you required to act on that possibility? No! Because **it&#8217;s less than 50%**&#8211;until the signs of certainty appear to you!
    
    Another proof is ahaad hadith (a hadith where, in the chain, at some point, there&#8217;s only one person narrating the hadith). Is it possible, in this case, that the one person made a mistake in the hadith? Yes. How possible is it&#8211;given the strict requirement of Saheeh Bukhari and the science of hadith? Very, very small; less than 1%. It&#8217;s not 100% certain that the hadith is correct&#8211;**but you are obliged to act as if it is certain.**
    
    So think about it. This applies to everything from selling iPods (where the majority are used for haram&#8211;music) to grapes (which may be ok or maybe not) to umbrellas.
    
    Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
