  Good teachers need good students, and good students need good teachers.
</p>

When either teachers or students are not up to par, knowledge wastes. Either the teacher fails to teach at their best capability, or the students learn nothing. The same concept can apply to leadership&#8211;good leaders require good followers, and good followers require good leaders.

Wallahu &#8216;alim. Are YOU a good teacher and a good student?

Something to think about inshaAllah.
