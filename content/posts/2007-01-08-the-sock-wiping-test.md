Stuck with only a chest-high sink for wudoo? Maybe you feel really tired and just want to make wudoo quickly so you can pray and sleep?

Then you&#8217;re in luck! Pass this quick test, and _you_ can just _wipe over_ your socks for wudoo!

  1. **Wudooified feet:** Were you in a state of purity (post-wudoo) _before_ you put on your socks?
  2. **Permanent socks:** Did you leave your socks on after losing wudoo? You can&#8217;t take them off if you want to wipe!
  3. **Smellified socks:** Are you within 24 hours (72 for travellers) of when you first broke wudoo after putting on your socks?

And that&#8217;s it! Wipe over the top of your socks, and you&#8217;re good to go!

Some other things to keep in mind:

  * You only need to wipe over the top of your socks.
  * Removing your socks if you wipe over for wudoo **breaks** your wudoo!
  * You can make wudoo over leather socks or any ol&#8217; socks&#8211;because the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) used to wipe over his _shoes_, according to some ahadith.
  * You can safely wipe regardless of how &#8220;holey&#8221; your socks are.

And Allah Almighty knows best.
