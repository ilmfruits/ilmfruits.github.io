The boy healed the blind and the lepers&#8211;the same miracles given to the prophet &#8216;Isa (Jesus), on whom be peace.

Was he a prophet?

No, he was not.

The difference is: Allah gave the boy <dfn title="honouring">karamah</dfn>, a less intense form of <dfn title="a prophetic miracle">mu&#8217;jizah</dfn>. In a way, karamah mimics mu&#8217;jizah, but to a less intense level.

The boy&#8217;s powers mimiced the miracles of &#8216;Isa (alayhi salaam), to a lesser level. And while &#8216;Isa (alayhi salaam) could resurrect the dead, the boy could not.

A similar incident occurred to a sahaba. When a king apostated, the sahaba gave him da&#8217;wah. In return, the king threw him into a fire. But like the miracle of Ibrahim (alayhi salaam), the fire did not burn the sahaba.

When you follow the path of the Prophets, and give da&#8217;wah, Allah tests you as he tested them (peace be upon them all). But inshaAllah you get karamah too.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
