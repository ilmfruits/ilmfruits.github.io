One of the best things about Islam is that it&#8217;s a _deen_&#8211;a total, comprehensive, complete, and _perfect_ way of life, and it governs every aspect of life from large-scale social phenomena (such as marriage) to the way you eat and sleep.

For people who are dating, subhanallah, they say they&#8217;re looking for that &#8220;special someone&#8221; or &#8220;the right person.&#8221; But they continue dating for 6 months, a year, two years, five years, TEN years, they have kids&#8211;they&#8217;re still just dating&#8211;and they STILL don&#8217;t know! And when someone &#8220;better&#8221; comes along, they jump ship!

But subhanallah, in our deen we have **salaatul istikhaara**, a prayer for indecision. Anytime you&#8217;re not sure about something, just hit up the nearest sink for wudoo&#8217;, pray two rakaahs (or omit this part, if you&#8217;re pressed for time) and ask Allah for guidance, with the du&#8217;a the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) taught us:

  <br /> <a href='/wp-content/uploads/dua-al-istikhara.gif' title='Dua al-Istikhara'><img src='/wp-content/uploads/dua-al-istikhara.gif' alt='Dua al-Istikhara' /></a><br />
</center>

**Transliteration:** Allahumma in kunta ta lamu anna (hathal-amra\*) khayul-lee fi deenee wama ashi wa ajila amri wa&#8217;ajilah, faqdurhu lee, wayassirhu lee, thumma-barik lee fih. Wa&#8217;in kunta ta lamu anna (hathal-amra\*) sharrul-lee fi deenee. Wama ashi. Wa ajila amri. Wa&#8217;ajilahu. Fasrifhu annee. Wasrifnee anh. Waqdur leyal-khayr haythu kan. Thumma ardini bih.

**Translation:** Oh Allah! I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power; I have none. And You know; I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. Oh Allah! If in Your knowledge, this matter is good for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs, immediate and in the future, then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge, this matter is bad for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs, immediate and in the future, then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it. And ordain for me the good wherever it may be, and make me content with it. (And then mention the matter)

What could be better then this? Within **five minutes**, you have the ultimate answer in your hands! If this person is the _best_ for you in this life and the _best_ for you in the akhira&#8211;in other words, the perfect person for you, and you for them&#8211;then Allah makes it easy! And if not, then Allah makes that easy too! No worries, no stress, no long-term investment required without a full after-life guarantee!

After all, everybody wants what&#8217;s best for them. So why not ask the All-Knowing, the All-Hearing, before you make the life-long (and after-life-long) plunge? And after that, he or she is your destiny, so accept it gracefully, and be thankful to Allah for this tremendous blessing. You have achieved what millions of people&#8211;with their clubs, their bars, their blind dates, their proms, and their parties&#8211;could only dream of: <span class="gem">a long-lasting, permanent relationship that is THE best for both of you, in both this life AND the eternal hereafter.</span>

May Allah purify our intentions and help us to achieve this great success (ameen)! (If you ARE thinking about getting married, or are already married, read [these ten tips for IMMEDIATE benefit][1] inshaAllah to your marriage.)
