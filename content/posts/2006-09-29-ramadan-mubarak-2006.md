Ramadan Mubarak to you and your families! May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) make this a most blessed and beneficial month for you all, and a source of taqwa and eman for the whole year, ameen!

Subhanallah, one of the companions of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) even said, &#8220;We spend half the year making du&#8217;a for Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to allow us to see another Ramdaaan, and we spend half the year making du&#8217;a for Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to accept the Ramdaan that passed.&#8221;

So **make good use** of this month inshallah, don&#8217;t let it pass you by! The key is to **plan** ahead&#8211;if you would like to finish reading the Qur&#8217;an, or attend taraweeh every night, or something else, make sure you plan it well ahead of time. And Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is the best of planners.

Some tips to get the most out of Ramadan while it lasts:

  * **Purify:** The same way you prepare your house when other guests arrive, prepare yourself for Ramadan&#8211;by purifying your soul! Make a resolution to avoid haram activities, foods, etc. and stick to it as best you can.
  * **Plan:** Plan what actions you intend to do this Ramadan. Read Qur&#8217;an every day? Finish it in thirty days? Pray Taraweeh three times a week?
  * **Pray:** Purify your intentions and pray for Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to accept your good deeds. May He accept all our good deeds this blessed month, ameen!
