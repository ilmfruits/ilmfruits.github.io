excerpt: 'In Surah Fajr, Allah talks about the human--how when he has wealth, he says: my Lord has honoured me. And when he loses it: my Lord has humiliated me. KALLA! This is a WRONG understanding. Why? What is it about these two statements that makes it incorrect? And where is it going?'

  What have you packed for the Hereafter?

**Note:** this is our 11th post in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma.

Allah says, in Surah Fajr:

> فَأَمَّا الْإِنسَانُ إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَأَكْرَمَهُ وَنَعَّمَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَكْرَمَنِ
  
> وَأَمَّا إِذَا مَا ابْتَلَاهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَهَانَنِ 

**Translation:** And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, &#8220;My Lord has honored me.&#8221; But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, &#8220;My Lord has humiliated me.&#8221; [Surah Fajr, verses 15-16]

You&#8217;ll notice here, Allah is commenting on the mentality of the human race. When Allah gives &#8230; the human being says: &#8220;My Lord has honoured me.&#8221;

Because it&#8217;s all about wealth &#8230; money &#8230; dunya. This is the metric we use. You see the president of a country? You&#8217;re very respectful. If the same president was a homeless bum asking you for change? You wouldn&#8217;t even look at him. We equate money with respect and honour &#8230; as Allah points out.

And the flip side? When Allah constrains the rizq, the human being says: &#8220;My lord has humiliated me.&#8221;

Notice &#8230; really notice, this person, what is his metric of honour or humiliation? It&#8217;s money. Wealth. Dunya! Nothing but shallow, shiny dunya, that will come to an end in a day or two, or maybe a year or two.

**Lesson: The test starts _in the good times_, not just in the bad times.** We recognize that 9/11 was a test; but we don&#8217;t realize that 9/10 and 9/9 and all those other days were a test, too&#8211;a test of thankfulness. But, as we saw in Surah &#8216;Ala, and again we&#8217;ll see in Surah &#8216;Aadiyaat, human beings prefer dunya over akhirah. They&#8217;re not thankful.

Then Allah says:

> كَلَّا!

Kalla! A very _strong, emphatic_ no&#8211;the same word you use if your child pulls something hot off the stove. Allah says: **this understanding is wrong.** Dead wrong. And in ayah 20, Allah says:

> وَتُحِبُّونَ الْمَالَ حُبّاً جَمّاً

**Translation:** And you love wealth with immense love.

Again, the theme of wealth, appearing again and again. So where is this going? Allah continues:

> كَلَّا إِذَا دُكَّتِ الْأَرْضُ دَكّاً دَكّاً
  
> وَجَاء رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفّاً صَفّاً
  
> وَجِيءَ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الْإِنسَانُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى
  
> يَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي قَدَّمْتُ لِحَيَاتِي 

_Kalla!_ When the earth has been leveled &#8211; pounded and crushed &#8211; and your Lord has come and the angels, rank upon rank, and brought [within view], that Day, is Hell &#8211; that Day, man will remember, but what good to him will be the remembrance? He will say, &#8220;Oh, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life.&#8221; [Surah Fajr, verses 21-14]

It goes to the Day of Judgment. _Kalla!_ when the earth has been pounded (dukkat), _dakkan dakka_&#8211;with a pounding after pounding after pounding. Grammatically, it&#8217;s _not_ emphasis&#8211;it&#8217;s pounding after pounding.

&#8220;And your Lord comes, with the angels, saffan saffa,&#8221; lines after lines of angels. How many angels? In one hadith, the Messenger of Allah said: &#8220;Hell will be brought forth that Day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be held by seventy thousand angels.&#8221;[Saheeh Muslim] [[source][1]]. Do the math&#8211;that&#8217;s almost 5 _billion_ angels. That&#8217;s a lot of angels! What an enormous creation Hellfire is!

And then Allah says: &#8220;That Day, man will remember, but what good to him will be the remembrance?&#8221; This is the end-result. The why of sending all the prophets, the reason behind all those MSA events, halaqahs, classes, conferences, khutbahs &#8230; reminder after reminder, but we just don&#8217;t want to be reminded. That day, we will _feel_ the reminder, when we see the Day of Judgment, and all its doings.

One last point to conclude, is that the human says &#8220;hayaatiy,&#8221; _my_ life, when he feels sad about what his hands sent forward. Why? Because this is his _real_ life. This is what life is&#8211;dunya is only a testing-grounds for 10, 20, maybe 50 or 70 years, then life, real life, begins. And we already discussed what kind of life the people of Hellfire are in, wa na&#8217;oodhubillah, may Allah protect us from that evil end.

This is a **wake-up call** to all those parents who don&#8217;t let their sons and daughters fast in Ramadan for fear of failing exams; to all those employees who won&#8217;t go to jumu&#8217;ah for fear of losing their jobs; to all those students who refuse to talk to their professors to get five minutes out for salah in the middle of an exam and choose to miss it.

You won&#8217;t _ruin_ your **life** &#8230;

&#8230; but you might ruin your **afterlife**. And that&#8217;s the real life, khaalideena fiyhi abadan, for ever and ever and ever without end.

**Action Items:**

  * **Realize the reality of honour and wealth.** Is there someone in your life you&#8217;re snubbing because they&#8217;re a bit lower-class than you in terms of money? Reconcile with them for the sake of Allah; especially if they&#8217;re practicing. Encourage them to be and do good.
  * **Prepare for your life.** You only have a few years left&#8211;maybe even a day or two. Start preparing. The best preparation is salah&#8211;start praying _now_, don&#8217;t miss another one! Pay any back-dated zakah you missed; start fasting Mondays and Thursdays; and ask Allah to accept it. Without that, what is dunya, except a blink of an eye?
  * **The tests have already begun.** You have food, shelter, a computer, friends, family&#8211;lots of things to be thankful for. Are you being thankful? Make du&#8217;a, sujood-ash-shukr, donate, whatever you can&#8211;because thankfulness is manifested in actions. The test starts _now_, not when you get hospitalized or you lose your job or flunk your class.

**Arabic Grammar and Vocabulary:**

  * **Hayaatiy (حَيَاتِي):** Hayaa means, among other things, life. The yaa at the end, yaa-u-mutakallim, makes it _my_ life&#8211;just like kitaabiy is _my_ book, or nafsiy is _my_ soul. (Also notice, the ta-marbuwta, the funny-face thing at the end, became a taa.)
  * **Al-Insaan (الْإِنسَانُ):** Humankind. Some scholars say the word is derived from the verb nasiya, which means to forget&#8211;because humans forget. Insaan means the entire human race, the same as an-naas.
  * **Al-Aard (الْأَرْضُ):** The earth. Sounds a lot like &#8220;Earth,&#8221; in English, doesn&#8217;t it? Technically speaking, this is one of the few feminine words that doesn&#8217;t end in ta-marbuwtah.
  * **Al-Malak (الْمَلَكُ):** Malak means &#8220;angel,&#8221; and the plural is &#8220;malaikah.&#8221; Notice the alif-lam, AL-malak, means the angels.
