In Surah Nisaa, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَاء فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَاء حَتَّىَ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتَّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيًّا وَلاَ نَصِيرًا
</div>

**Translation:** They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike; therefore take not from among them friends until they forsake (their homes) in Allah&#8217;s way; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper (Surah Nisaa, 4:89)<sup>1</sup>

This ayah talks about hijrah (migration) and the Islamic state, and what happens to those who don&#8217;t migrate when they should.  Are they Muslim?  Kafir?  Munafiq?  If you study the tafseer, you&#8217;ll see that it refers to the munafiqiyn (hypocrites).
  
One characteristic of hypocrites mentioned here is that they want for you to disbelieve, too. It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re just wishy-washy on Islam. (In our context, you see people with these characteristics&#8211;if you work or attend a post-secondary institute, you&#8217;ve probably run into &#8220;Muslims&#8221; who, for example, drink and don&#8217;t pray&#8211;and they push you to do the same.)

Contemplate the statement &#8220;&#8230; until they forsake their homes in Allah&#8217;s way.&#8221; Truly, those who forsake their homes give up everything&#8211;most of their property, their jobs, and their lives&#8211;to move to a new place. That itself attests to their sincerety and their character (when done for the sake of Allah).

And remember: in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, they moved from their comfort zones to Al-Medina, a small city surrounded by enemies who plotted constantly to attack.

Regarding the last part of the verse, &#8220;&#8230; seize them and kill them wherever you find them &#8230;&#8221; (often quoted in the media, ho hum), the <dfn title="scholars who write or compile tafseer">mufasireen</dfn> put conditions on this. The situation is that the Islamic state springs up, the command for <dfn title="migration">hijrah</dfn> comes, they refuse, and they excise extreme hostility towards the state&#8211;a billigerent non-Muslim state plotting against you. In this case, you can fight; but not otherwise.

For example, if the hostile state is Muslim, the rules change&#8211;this doesn&#8217;t apply to the conflict between &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;awiya, may Allah be pleased with both of them. This verse does not allow vigilantism.

And finally, if the command comes and Muslims don&#8217;t make <dfn title="migration">hijrah</dfn>, but they don&#8217;t fight the state, special rules still apply to them&#8211;for example, you cannot marry them or do business with them.

And Allah is the All-Knowing, All Wise.
