excerpt: "Ibn Kathir, in his tafseer of the ayaat about the Slaves of Ar-Rahman, mentions the translation that they sleep little and pray to Allah at night with fear and hope, and asking for forgiveness.  Ibn Abbaas mentions that it's very easy to get this same reward (to be written as the muhsinoon!)--all you have to do is pray two extra rak'aahs (but when?) ..."

In Suratul-Furqaan (Surah 25), ayah 63, Allah begins a description of what is translated as &#8220;the slaves of Ar-Rahmaan (Allah)&#8230;&#8221;

<div class="quran">
  &#8230;عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَنِ
</div>

In ayah 64, He describes these &#8220;slaves&#8221; by saying:

<div class="quran">
  َالَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَبِّهِمْ سُجَّداً وَقِيَاماً …
</div>

This is translated as: those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrating (in sujood) and standing.

Tafsir ibn Kathir explains this ayah, and compares it to ayahs 17-18 from Suratuth-Thaariyaat (Surah 51):

<div class="quran">
  كَانُوا قَلِيلاً مِّنَ اللَّيْلِ مَا يَهْجَعُونَ وَبِالْأَسْحَارِ هُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** They used to sleep but little by night \[invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope]. And in the hours before dawn, they were (found) asking (Allah) for forgiveness. [Surah Ath-Thaariyaat\] (translated by Muhsin Khan).

Ibn Kathir explains that this is a &#8220;good act&#8221; that the Muhsinun (good-doers) perform. [1]

According to a footnote in the The Noble Qur&#8217;an: English Translation of the meanings and commentary, Tafsir Al-Qurtubi states:

> Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه‏) said: &#8220;Whoever prayed two rak&#8217;at or more after the &#8216;Isha (night) prayer, will be considered like those mentioned in this verse [i.e. V.25:64].&#8221; And Al-Kalbi said: &#8220;Whosoever prayed two rak&#8217;at after the Maghrib (evening) prayer, and four rak&#8217;at after the &#8216;Isha (night) prayer will be considered like those mentioned in this verse.&#8221; 

SubhanAllah, I imagine most people probably already pray at least two ruk&#8217;as after Maghrib and three after &#8216;Isha (two ruk&#8217;as sunnah and then one for witr), so all that remains is two more ruk&#8217;ah! Just two more ruk&#8217;ah to qualify under one of the acts performed by the muhsinoon? Under the criteria presented by Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Al-Kalbi (رضي الله عنهما‏) it seems the answer is YES, wallahu ta’aala a’alem (and Allah, exalted is He, knows best)!

Just two more ruk&#8217;ah every night—By the permission of Allah, let’s make it a habit for His sake!

May He make us of the Muhsinun and those with whom He is well pleased. Ameen!

[1] The &#8220;Muhsinun&#8221; are identified in ayahs 15-16 of the same surah (Surah 51). The ayahs are translated as: &#8220;Verily, the Muttaqun (pious &#8211; see V.2:2) will be in the midst of hardens and springs (in Paradise), taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this Muhsinun (good-doers &#8211; see V.2:112).&#8221;
