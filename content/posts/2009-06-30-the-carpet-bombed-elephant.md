_This is post #21 in our series on Tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma (click the link to see all posts in this series)._

The Sabab-un-Nuzool (reason of revelation) for Surah Fil well-known; you can read all about it, along with some lessons and gems, in [this post by Sr. Mariam 3.36][1]. Please read it, since I won&#8217;t touch on those points.

I will mention, however, two points not mentioned there&#8211;that the Christian tyrant king who brought his elephant, why did he decide to destroy the Ka&#8217;bah? He saw how well-known the Ka&#8217;bah was, and how great to the people; so he _built a church to rival that_.

So he built this huge, huge church; not realizing that it&#8217;s Allah who puts the love of Ka&#8217;bah in the hearts of the people. Honestly, the Ka&#8217;bah has a very simple architectural structure; but it&#8217;s more beloved than many buildings that are much more beautiful than it.

So one of the bedouins went to his church. &#8220;Oh, this is your ka&#8217;bah? Here you go.&#8221; And pooped in it.

That&#8217;s bedouins for you!

So the king got angry &#8230; very angry. And he decided to destroy the Ka&#8217;bah. Remember, these are _tyrant_ kings we&#8217;re talking about.

### The Quraysh Made Noble

Allah says, in Surah Fil:

> أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ
  
> أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِي تَضْلِيلٍ 

**Translation:** Have you not considered, [O Muhammad], how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant? Did He not make their plan into misguidance? [Surah Fil, verses 1-2]

This incident&#8211;the incident of Surah Fil&#8211;was well-known among the Arabs at that time. In fact, the Messenger of Allah, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, was born in the Year of the Elephant&#8211;the year that this incident occurred.

Look at the details of the story&#8211;the Meccans took their camels and sheep and goats, and they went up into the bleachers, the mountains of Mecca, to watch; the tank, the war-elephant of the Christian king, against the ka&#8217;bah.

Allah destroyed them&#8211;and in doing this, it seemed that He, subhannahu wa ta&#8217;ala, sided with _mushrikeen_ of Mecca against _Christians_. But really, Allah was defending His great house.

And this showed the Quraysh, the keepers of the Ka&#8217;bah, that Allah sided with _them!_ So immediately, their status and nobility went up among the other Arabs; so much so, that raiders and looters wouldn&#8217;t accost their caravans.

If you&#8217;ve ever lived in India/Pakistan/China/etc. and seen how people crowd around someone from America/Canada and how they&#8217;re treated well &#8230; that&#8217;s what happened to the Quryash after this.

Muhammad Alshareef mentions that when he was in Alexandria, in Egypt, some little kid was accosting him; so he started beating the kid up. And the kid&#8217;s bigger sister&#8211;like twice his age&#8211;came and started pounding and pounding on him.

And he went down! And all the kids around her wer saying, _huwa kaanadi, huwa kaanadi_&#8211;he&#8217;s Canadian, he&#8217;s Canadian!&#8211;and the girl herself cried from what she had done.

Just like that, the Allah raised the status of Quraysh.

### Tiny Little Birds, Abaabeel

Allah continues, in verses 3-4:

> وَأَرْسَلَ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ
  
> تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ 

**Translation:** And He sent against them birds in flocks (abaabeel), striking them with stones of hard clay,[verses 3-4]

The mufassireen mention, from this ayah, that the birds were small birds. Little birds. Tiny birds. What&#8217;s a tiny little bird going to do against an elephant? Nothing!

But Allah didn&#8217;t just send one, or two, or three; he sent them &#8230; _ababeel_. Waves and waves and _waves_ of birds that darkened the sky.

And each bird had two stones&#8211;one in its beak, and one in its talons. You ever see those tall, tall buildings (Empire State building? CN Tower?), and someone is always tempted to throw a penny from the top floor? What would happen if that hit someone?

What about thousands and thousands of pennies, flying at high-speed? It&#8217;s almost like the birds carpet-bombed the army with little tiny rocks.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/seagulls-ababeel.jpg" alt="waves and waves of birds" title="waves and waves of birds" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1224" />

_This_ is the army of Allah. And we see that he destroys great creations, with the smallest of creations. Like Firawn, who was killed by _water_, something you drink every day.

### Not a Passive God

Allah finishes with verse 5:

> فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ

**Translation:** And He made them like eaten straw.

If you&#8217;ve ever seen, like corn on the cob, while it&#8217;s on the cob&#8211;you&#8217;ll see this tall, dense wall of green and yellow. A day later, when all that corn has been picked off, you just see these green husks; and even that, the cows and goats come and eat that, and it becomes like a dead field.

Allah describes the army of the elephant as _eaten straw_. This means that they were _pulverized_. Obliterated. Annihilated. Destroyed utterly and completely.

Why is this relevant to Meccan tafseer? Because the Quraysh were oppressing the Muslims, torturing the Muslims, killing the Muslims; and Allah is warning them: stop, _or else_.

And you might say, as a Meccan mushrik, &#8220;Can Allah _really_ destroy a people like that?&#8221;

And the answer is &#8230; _He already has._

And this is a stern warning to all those who are oppressing and torturing and killing Muslims in the land. Don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re fighting against some passive God. Allah has _already destroyed waves of nations more powerful than you._ It&#8217;s not a question of &#8220;can He?&#8221; It&#8217;s more like &#8220;when?&#8221;

### Action Items

  * **Reflect on Natural Disasters:** Natural disasters (hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes) are from Allah. Use YouTube to find videos of these. Watch them. This is the power of Allah at work!
  * **Post your own Action Items.** I really don&#8217;t have anything else that comes to my mind.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alam.
