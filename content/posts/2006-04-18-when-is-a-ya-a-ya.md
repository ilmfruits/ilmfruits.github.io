In Arabic, there is the letter Ya: ي. It is pronounced similar to the letter Y in English.

However, there&#8217;s also another type of ya&#8211;the ya without dots, which looks like this: ى. As for that ya, sometimes pronounced as a ya, and sometimes, as an alif (ا).

For example, the word على (ayn-lam-ya) can be read as &#8216;ala (on top: عَلَى) or as &#8216;Ali (as in the name: عَلِي). So how do you know when to pronounce it as a ya, and when to pronounce it as an alif?

There are two signs that indicate that it&#8217;s a ya:

  1. **Dots:** If the ya has two dots under it, it&#8217;s a ya!
  2. **Harakat:** If the letter _before_ the ya has a fatha on it, then the ya is pronounced as an alif; if the letter before has a kasra, then the ya is pronounced as a ya.

And if you understand Arabic enough to get the context of the sentence, that helps too.
