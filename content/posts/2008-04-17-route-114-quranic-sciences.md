  Route 114: Qur&#8217;anic Sciences
</div>

[Route 114: Qur&#8217;anic Sciences][1] is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Yasir Qadhi.

The science of the Qur&#8217;an: one of the sciences that reaches out into and forms a foundation for almost every other Islamic science. Topics include: the definition of the Qur&#8217;an, the rewards of the Qur&#8217;an, the blessings of the Qur&#8217;an, the origin of the Qur&#8217;an, the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an (tajweed); the science of qira&#8217;at; ahruf; the science of tafseer; wahiy (revelation); Mecci and Madani verses; the arrangement of surahs and ayahs; abrogation; the miraculous nature of the Qur&#8217;an; translation; memorization.

What a list! And Uloom-ul-Qur&#8217;an touches on _all these fields_, many of which are sub-fields (specializations) of Uloom-ul-Qur&#8217;an! Almost anything you want to know about the Qur&#8217;an is here! So hit up the links below, and learn all about this beautiful, much-neglected book of our times: The Qur&#8217;an.
