<p class="gem">
  The key to attract an amazing spouse is to nurture in yourself those qualities that appeal to a person of that standard.
</p>

Many of us pine for the perfect spouse&#8211;realize **he or she does not exist**. Pick the _best_ you can find, and learn to live with and cover their warts and weaknesses.

Set your criteria (based on the hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him)&#8211;have they memorized the Qur&#8217;an? Do they speak Arabic? Do they pray Tahajjud (middle-of-the-night prayer) once a week?&#8211;then ask yourself what a person of those qualities would like in a spouse, and instill those qualities into yourself.

And always double-check your intention to make sure your actions are to please Allah alone.

When you succeed, <dfn title="by the permission of Allah">bi ithnillah</dfn>, _they_ will seek _you_ out.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) make us all among those who uphold the deen to the highest standard and take it to new heights.
