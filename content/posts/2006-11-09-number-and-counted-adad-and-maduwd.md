Arabic has specific grammar rules for <dfn title="عَدَد">&#8216;Aadad</dfn> and <dfn title="مَعدُود">Ma&#8217;duwd</dfn>&#8211;the number and the counted.

**Note:** These rules apply for numbers from three to ten.  One and two are special-they count as adjectives, not numbers, because the form of the word implies the number.
  
In English, we say &#8220;three cars&#8221;. Three is the number (&#8216;adad), and cars is the counted (ma&#8217;duwd).

What are the grammatical rules of &#8216;adad and ma&#8217;duwd?

Similar to time modifiers, &#8216;adad and ma&#8217;duwd work like [possessive case][1]. The &#8216;adad **always comes first,** and it behaves like the possessor&#8211;so it&#8217;s **definite**. The ma&#8217;duwd comes next, and it behaves like the possessed&#8211;so it **takes kasra**.

The other rule is that **&#8216;adad and ma&#8217;duwd have opposite genders**&#8211;so one will be masculine and one will be feminine. Which determines the other? The ma&#8217;duwd (counted thing) determines the gender of the &#8216;adad (number).

One implicit rule is that **the ma&#8217;duwd is always plural**&#8211;which is true because we&#8217;re counting more then two.  (In Arabic, we have singular, dual, and then plural&#8211;so two is not plural.)

So say we wanted to say &#8220;five students&#8221;. Students is &#8220;<dfn title="طُلَّابُن">tullaabun</dfn>&#8221; (masculine), five is &#8220;<dfn title="خَمسَ">khamsa</dfn>&#8220;.

So our first guess might be &#8220;khamsa tullaabun&#8221;.

But then, we realize tullaabun is masculine, so we feminize &#8220;five&#8221; by adding ta-marbuwta. Our next guess might be &#8220;khamsatun tullaabun&#8221;.

Then we remember that they act like the possessive case&#8211;so student takes kasra. The final (correct) version is &#8220;<dfn title="خَمسَةٌ طُلَّابِن">khamsatun tullaabin</dfn>&#8220;.

What about &#8220;three cows&#8221;? Three is thalathun, cows is baqaraat&#8211;so we get &#8220;<dfn title="ثَلَاثٌ بَقَرَاتٍ">thalathun baqaraatin</dfn>&#8220;.

Four pens? <dfn title="أربَعَةُ أقلَامٍ">Arba&#8217;atun aqlaamin</dfn>! Again, it&#8217;s Arba&#8217;a**tun** because aqlaam (pens) is masculine.

Seven spoons? <dfn title="سَبعَ مِاعَقَةٍ">Sab&#8217;aa mil&#8217;aqatin</dfn>! Sab&#8217;a, no sab&#8217;a**h** (with ta-marbuwta), because mil&#8217;aqah (spoons) is feminine.

Inshallah you can find some of these in the Qur&#8217;an and post them in the comments&#8211;the &#8216;adad, ma&#8217;duwd, and the verse they occur in.
