Continuing in our series of ways to attain [purification in salaah][1]: Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur’an:

<div class="quran">
  وَرَتِّلِ الْقُرْآنَ تَرْتِيلاً
</div>

_**“&#8230; and recite the Qur’an in slow, measured rhythmic tones” (Surah al-Muzammil 73:4)**_

From this alone, we see the importance of reciting the Qur’an in a proper manner–slowly and with a rythmic tone–and not just whizzing through it as if we were reading a magazine of some sort. Also, our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had a recitation which was clear, with each letter proncounced distinctly (Ahmad, 6/294, [saheeh][2]). You can easily begin to comprehend the likliness of gaining khusoo’ while reciting in a slow, calm voice rather than fast, abrubt voice. To list a few reasons:

  * Your heart is more easily attached with the beauty of the Qur’an and the the Arabic language.
  * It brings focus to your salaah and deminishes outside thoughts.
  * You are able to ponder upon the ayaat you&#8217;re reciting!

Another great way of attaining khusoo’ in one’s prayer is to make our voices beautiful while reciting; to have our emotions fuse to one with the words of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and to express that in your voice. Our noble Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said:

_**“Beautify the Qur’an with your voices, for a fine voice increases the Qur’an in beauty.” (al-Haakim, 1/575, saheeh al-jaami’)**_

Subhanallah! Something already as beautiful and perfect as the Qur’an has the ability to become even more so with our recitation! What a privilage Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has granted this ummah! May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) give us all the ability to realize this great blessing and give us the ability and understanding to recite the Qur’an in the best of manners, ameen!

**_A recap of the different ways to attain khushoo&#8217; is salaah:_**

  1. [Prepere for it][3]: perform wu&#8217;du with perfection, use miswak.
  2. [Relax][4]: don&#8217;t rush, its not a race!
  3. [Remember the innevitable][5]: It might be that its your last prayer.
  4. [Conversing with Allah][6]: remember, salaah is your connection with Allah.
