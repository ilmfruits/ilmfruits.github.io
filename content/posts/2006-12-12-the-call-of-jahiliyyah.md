Once a young man from the <dfn title="those who made Hijrah (migration) from Mecca to Medinah">Muhajiruwn</dfn> and a young man from the <dfn title="those Muslims who accepted Islam in Medinah already and helpe out the muhajiruwn">Ansaar</dfn> quarreled. So the muhajirun called out for help stating: &#8220;O Muhajiruwn!&#8221; And the ansaari said: &#8220;O Ansaar!&#8221; The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) heard this and said: &#8221;Is it with the call off <dfn title="literally 'ignorance', the days prior to Islam">jahiliyyah</dfn> that you are calling out, and I am present amongst you!&#8221; (Bukhari)

Allah loves Muhajiruwn and Ansaar. Allah states (interpretation of the meaning) : &#8220;And [those Allah grants mercy on includes] the first to embrace Islam from the Muhajiruwn and the Ansaar, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.&#8221; [Surah at-Tawbah 9:100].

Still, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8221;Is it with the call off jahiliyyah that you are calling out, and I am present amongst you!&#8221;

Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Whosoever leaves off obedience and separates from the Jamaa&#8217;ah and dies, he dies a death of jahiliyyah. Whoever fights under the banner of the blind, becoming angry for &#8216;asabiyyah (partisanship and party spirit), or calling to &#8216;asabiyyah, or assisting &#8216;asabiyyah, then dies, he dies a death of jahiliyyah.&#8221; (Muslim)

And look at the pride (which is not even worth a peanut shell) people have, one might say &#8220;we fought you, and then we kicked you out of our land.&#8221; On this point, Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;lndeed, Allah revealed to me that you should have humility, and that no one should act proudly and oppressively over anyone else, nor should anyone boast over anyone else. &#8221; (Muslim)

And to cap our discussion, Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said:&#8221;Everything which is outside the call of Islam and the Qur&#8217;an, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thought, and ways, then it is from the calls of jahiliyyah.
