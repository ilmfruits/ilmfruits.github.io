  Code of Scholars
</div>

[Code of Scholars][1] is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Muhammad Alshareef. The course teaches the basics of the science of Usool ul-Fiqh, derived from the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah. What does haram mean? Who makes laws? What are the different types of fard actions? What Arabic keywords indicate something is haram? Students who succeed gain the ability to analyze contradicting <dfn title="plural of fatwa">fatawa</dfn> and determine which are more correct islamically.
