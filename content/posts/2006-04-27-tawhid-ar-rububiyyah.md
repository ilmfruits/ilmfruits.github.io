Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah can be roughly translated as **&#8220;Unity/Oneness of Lordship&#8221;**. It pertains to **Allah** (سبحانه وتعالى), and His lordship.

  Definition
</div>

Rububiyyah is from rabb (ربّ), which has three linguistic meanings:

  1. **Owner:** The rabb is the true and complete owner. In one hadith, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;if you find a camel in the desert, leave it till it meets its _rabb_ (owner)&#8221;.
  2. **Obediance:** The rabb is the one who is to be obeyed. In Surah Yusuf, Yusuf (عليه سلام) said to one of the prisoners: &#8220;you&#8217;re going to give your _rabb khamar_ (the king) &#8230;&#8221;
  3. **Nourisher:** The rabb is the one who nourishes and takes care of everything.

We **combine** these to get the Islamic definition of rabb: Allah is the one who **creates**, **sustains**, and **owns** the entire creation. He alone is the Master, the Controller, the Nourisher, the one who creates from nothing. He has the right to **each and every atom** of creation.

  All of Creation is under Rububiyyah
</div>

In Surah Baqarah, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  بَل لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَانِتُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him. ([Surah Baqarah][1], verse 116)<sup>1</sup>

Each and every creation must bow down to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) . No atom escapes Him.

  1. **Survival:** None of us can survive on our own. Therefore, we are not rabbs.
  2. **Fate:** No object can escape its fate.
  3. **Death:** All humans call out to Allah when death comes near them.

<div class="miniTitle">
  General Rububiyyah
</div>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) creates, sustains, nourishes, and owns everything, without exception. When Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) mentions himself as &#8220;Lord of the Worlds&#8221;, that is an example of general rububiyyah.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Specific Rububiyyah
</div>

Additionally, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) provides spiritual sustance to Muslims.

The majority of du&#8217;as in the Qur&#8217;an start with rabb. Why rabb? To make us acknowledge our special relationship, our dependance. For this exact reason, <span class="gem">one of the best names to use when you make du&#8217;a is rabb.</span>

When Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) mentions himself as the Lord of Musa or the Lord of Harun, or something similar, that is an example of specific rububiyyah.
