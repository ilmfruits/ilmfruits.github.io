A Muhaddith is one who studies and memorizes ahadith, and internalizes the science of hadith&#8211;the science that allows us to dissect and analyze ahadith and sort the authentic from the un-authentic. (You can read more about ahadith and their statuses [here][1].) This includes memorizing the biographies of people involved in the narration, including their strengths and weaknesses (in terms of memory and piety).

<span class="gem">Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-ud-Deen al-Albani, one of the greatest scholars of recent times, also studied ahadith and became a muhaddith&#8211;one the likes of we have not seen in centuries.</span> This is why many contemporaries&#8211;scholars, imams, teachers&#8211;often will quote a hadith as saheeh or da&#8217;eef and say &#8220;according to Shaykh Al-Albani&#8221;. May Allah forgive his sins and accept all the amazing work he completed during his lifetime, ameen!

You can find a brief sketch of his life [here][2], if you would like more details.
