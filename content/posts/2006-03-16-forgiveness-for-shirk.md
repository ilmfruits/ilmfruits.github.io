Allah blessed me with the opportunity to listen to Shaykh Yasir Qadhi, who specializes in Aqeeda, speak about shirk. Here&#8217;s what he said.

**Question:** What happens if you&#8217;re Muslim and you&#8217;ve committed shirk?

**Answerer:** Shaykh Yasir Qadhi

In the Qur&#8217;an, in many places, Allah says shirk is unforgivable.

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا
</div>

**Translation:** Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he devises indeed a great sin. (Surah Nisaa, verse 48)<sup>1, 2<br /> </sup>

Notice Allah says he &#8220;forgives what is besides that&#8221;&#8211;that means _any_ sin is potentially forgivable. Subhanallah.

So what happens if you&#8217;re Muslim, and you commit an act of shirk? Does it destroy all your good deeds? Are you doomed to enter Jahannam, may Allah protect us all from that?

&#8220;Allah does not forgive [shirk]&#8221; means Allah will not forgive the person if he doesn&#8217;t repent. <span class="gem">Repentance wipes out <strong>every sin, without exception</strong></span>. Many sahaba (may Allah be pleased with all of them) were mushrikoon when they accepted Islam.

The point is, if you commit shirk and **die without repenting**, Allah will **not forgive you**. If you fornicate, drink alcohol, consume interest, steal, and you **repent** afterward, Allah **will forgive you** inshaAllah. If you **don&#8217;t repent** from those sins and you **die**, Allah **_may_** forgive you. With shirk, if you **die** with it **unrepented**, Allah **will not** forgive you.

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) **saught refuge from shirk** and taught us a wonderful du&#8217;a to protect ourselves:

![Dua for Protection from Shirk][1]

<p class="dua">
  Allaahumma innee ‘aoothu bika an ushrika bika shaiann wa anaa a’lamu, wa astaghfiruka limaa laa a’lamu.
</p>

Translation: O Allah, I seek refuge in You lest I associate anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for what I know not.

Source: The collection of Ahmad. You can find the du&#8217;a in Fortress of a Muslim. You can find more details more in the comments inshaAllah.

May Allah protect us all from the evil of shirk, and allow us to live and die as true Muslims.
