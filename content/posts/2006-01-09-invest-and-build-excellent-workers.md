  Good workers are rare. Great workers are more rare. Outstanding workers are still more rare.
</p>

Instead of investing hundreds of hours in the search for excellent workers, take what you can get&#8211;given that they hold _some_ of the attributes you need, and the potential to grow&#8211;and increase them in their excellence.

This way, not only do **you** benefit from the work they produce, but **they** benefit from the training. Think of it as an investment that pays off long-term.
