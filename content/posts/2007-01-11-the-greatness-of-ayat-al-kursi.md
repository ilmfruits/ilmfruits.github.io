Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&#8217;an: 

<div class="quran">
  اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَهَ~َ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ لاَ تَأْخُذُه ُُ سِنَة ٌ وَلاَ نَوْم ٌ لَه ُُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ~ُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِه ِِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْء ٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ~ِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَاءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ وَلاَ يَئُودُه ُُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ
</div>

<p align="center">
  <strong>&#8220;Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is Al-Aliyy (the Most High), Al-Athiym (the Supreme (in glory)).&#8221; (</strong><em>Surah Baqarah verse 255</em>)
</p>

This ayah is the single greatest ayah found in the Qur&#8217;an. How befitting it is to be given that status, Subhanallah. This status was surely not given by me, but rather by our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم).

The best of creations, Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had asked &#8216;Ubayy bin Ka&#8217;b about the greatest ayah in the Book of Allah, and &#8216;Ubayy answered, &#8220;_Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221;_ The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) kept repeating the question several times to &#8216;Ubay, which led him to finally say _&#8220;Ayatul-Kursi.&#8221;_ To that, the Messenger of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) commented, _&#8220;Congratulations for having knowledge, O Abu Al-Mundhir! By He in Whose Hand is my soul! This Ayah has a tounge and two lips with which she praises The King (Allah) next to the leg of the Throne.&#8221;_ 

Subhanallah! This is the status of this great ayah. This is the greatness of this ayah. May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) give us the understanding of this ayah and all His words.
