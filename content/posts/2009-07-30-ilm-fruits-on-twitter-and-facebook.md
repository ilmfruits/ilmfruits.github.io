As-salaamu &#8216;alikum wa rahmatullah,

We are very pleased to announce that Ilm Fruits has now extended to [Facebook][1] and to [Twitter][2].

Rather than, like other Islamic organizations and groups, following hype, we hope that this will allow us to solve the following problems:

  1. **Facebook Updates:** Would you like to see new posts on Ilm Fruits immediately in Facebook? We&#8217;ve added a [Facebook user][1] to facilitate this; just add it as your friend.
  2. **Feedback:** The point of our [twitter user][2] (and facebook user) is to allow people to give us more feedback, beyond just the blog commenting system.

So start using them! We hope this move will allow us to connect more with you, the end-users of our blog. May Allah put barakah in our efforts and accept them (ameen ya rabbi!)

P.S. for all twitter users who add us, we&#8217;ve added a link to a secret new project that we&#8217;re going to launch in Ramadan, insha&#8217;Allah! So hook up and check out the link!
