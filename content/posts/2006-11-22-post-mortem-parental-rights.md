Ok, so you parents have rights upon you while they live. Most of us know that. **What about after they&#8217;ve left this life?** Is it possible they might still have some rights due from you?

The answer is a resounding _yes!_ Their rights, after they die, are:

  1. **Janaazah:** That you (or someone in the community) washes their body, buries them, etc., and you pray their <dfn title="funeral prayer after someone passes away">janaazah prayer</dfn> with the community.
  2. **Istighfaar:** Among the few surprise good deeds a person finds after they die are from <span class="gem">a child who prays for them and seeks forgiveness for them.</span> Provided they&#8217;re Muslim, of course&#8211;in the Qur&#8217;an, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) prohibited praying for dead non-Muslims.
  3. **Oaths:** If they made any (halal) pledges or oaths, or if they wrote a will, fulfill it on their behalf.
  4. **Friends:** Honour their friends. Abdullah ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه), while riding his donkey, saw an old bedouin man walking. He got off his donkey, said salaam, gave the man his turban, his donkey, and his garment! People asked, why? He said, <span class="gem">he used to be my father&#8217;s friend.</span> Subhanallah! Visit their friends! Bring them gifts sometimes! The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) used to visit the friends of Khadija (رضي الله عنها), his first wife, after her death.
  5. **Kinship:** Keep the ties of the womb (i.e. kinship) for the sake of our parents.

So fulfill their rights if you outlive them. May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) allow us to be a mercy for our parents and to earn his mercy through them, ameen!
