Arabic Grammar consists almost entirely of putting <dfn title="vowels: fatha, kasra, dumma, and tanween">harakaat</dfn> on letters.

Arabic writing is typically written without the harakaat. How is it possible to read? One must learn slowly, piece by piece, and read with _understanding_. Arabic is not like English&#8211;you have to actively read and consciously think while you read about what it means. (At least, when you start out.)

Why are harakaat important? <span class="gem">Harakaat determine the meaning of words and sentences entirely.</span> A different choice of harakaat can sometimes invert the meaning of a sentence entirely!

For example, this word: ضرب (daad-ra-ba) can mean hit (ضَرَبَ: daraba), hitting (ضَرْبٌ: darboon), was hit (ضُرِبَ: duriba), and more! Another word is من (meem-noon) which can mean from (مِن: min) or who (مَن: man), and so on.

InshaAllah ta&#8217;ala now that you know, start paying attention to the vowels as you read Qur&#8217;an. It makes all the difference.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grant us all knowledge of Arabic, the language of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an, ameen!
