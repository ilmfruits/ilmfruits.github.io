Those five categories of all actions&#8211;fard (also known as wajib), mustahab (sometimes called &#8220;sunnah&#8221;), mubah, makrooh, and haram&#8211;what do they really mean? While you can understand these from different angles, we explain these from an Usool-ul-Fiqh perspective. Here they are:

**Fard/Wajib** (obligatory) means any action that you **earn a reward** for performing, and **earn a punishment** from abstaining from. Examples include praying, fasting, etc.

**Mustahab/Sunnah** (recommended) means any action that you **earn a reward** for performing, and **earn nothing** from abstaining from. Examples include breaking your fast as soon as it&#8217;s Maghrib time, praying two rakaahs after Maghrib, using miswaak, etc.

**Mubah** (permissible) means any action you **earn nothing** from performing, and **earn nothing** from abstaining from&#8211;though with the right intentions, these can be _promoted or demoted into the other categories_. More on that [here][1]. Examples include eating food, sleeping, and blinking.

**Makrooh** (hated) means any action you **earn nothing** from performing, and **earn a reward** from abstaining from. Examples include staying awake after &#8216;Isha time.

**Haraam** (prohibited) means any action you **earn a punishment** from performing, and **earn a reward** for abstaining from. Examples include eating pork, murder, and adultry.

Note these amazing facts: <span class="gem">you earn a reward for abstaining from haram actions</span>&#8211;every sin you turn away from earns you good deeds! You also <span class="gem">earn a reward for mubah acts, with the proper intention</span>&#8211;Salmaan Al-Farasi (radiallahu &#8216;anhu) said, &#8220;I expect Allah to reward me in my sleep the way he rewards me for Tahajjud.&#8221; Subhanallah. Similarly, <span class="gem">intentionally avoiding makrooh acts nets you good deeds!</span> How&#8217;s that for motivation!

So set your intentions straight before another second passes by, and inshallah you&#8217;ll find huge mountains of good deeds waiting for you in the akhira! We ask Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to help us all earn that reward, ameen!
