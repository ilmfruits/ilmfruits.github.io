**&#8220;I guarantee a house in Jannah (Paradise) for one who gives up arguing, even if he is in the right; and I guarantee a house in the middle of Jannah for one who abandons lying even when joking / for the sake of fun; and I guarantee a house in the highest part of Jannah for one who has good manners.&#8221;** [Prophet Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; reported by Imam Abu Dawud]

<u>Lessons:</u>

  1. <span class="gem">When in the middle of a heated argument over anything, just remember: Rasoolullah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) has promised YOU a house in Paradise if you give up this argument.</span> What&#8217;s better: winning an argument and feeling tough and strong (while in the process, maybe hurting others and maybe disrespecting the Islamic adaab), or a house in Jannah?
  2. &#8220;I&#8217;m not lying, I&#8217;m only kidding, yo!&#8221; Nuh uh, a lie is a lie &#8211; even if it&#8217;s meant to be a joke. Making jokes is cool, but only if they are truthful and don&#8217;t hurt others. When making a joke that is not true, ask yourself: is picking up a big sin better just to amuse others and make myself look cool, or is a house in the middle of Jannah better?
  3. Subhan Allah, I notice that with ahadith relating to adaab (etiquettes, manners), the incentive mentioned in a hadith is mostly Jannah. In this case, it&#8217;s the highest part of Jannah!! It&#8217;s almost as if good adaab are a stairway to Jannah. Why? Our adaab mostly affect those around us, and thus good adaab benefit those around us and bad adaab hurt those around us. Wallahu alim. One awesome way to improve our adaab can be found [here][1].

May Allah give us the tawfeeq to perfect our manners and conduct, and may He enter us into the highest part of Jannah, ameen.
