<p class="gem">
  Consultation, or <span class="foreignWord">shura</span>, is a fundamental leadership technique in Islam. You consult with the experts, and you implement it, and you close the issue.
</p>

<p class="gem">
  Shura means consultation. It also means the consulted group. Shura is a <strong>fundamental technique</strong> in leadership. The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), the best and most knowledable and noble of people, practiced shura with his companions&#8211;and who knew better than he? How can the rest of us believe we don&#8217;t <em>need</em> shura?
</p>

Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu &#8216;anh) said: I never saw someone who seeks consulation of his comrades more than the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم).

How does one consult properly? Follow these steps inshaAllah:

  1. **Clear your heart.** Remember, no matter how much you know, shura benefits you inshaAllah. Remember, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) made shura with his companions.
  2. **Consult with your Lord.** Ask Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Pray two rakaat of istikhara. Who knows the solution to all your problems better than He?
  3. **Consult the experts.** Seek those proficient in the field in question and consult with them. Explain the situation. _Listen to their opinions._ Even if you find only one other person suitable, consult them.
  1. **Be wary of consulting all people.** Remember, _if someone doesn&#8217;t have something, they can&#8217;t give it to you._ That includes knowledge and advice. Don&#8217;t ask your barber how to fix your computer.
  2. **Concede to antagonists.** If you know some people provide an opposing view point, include them in your discussion. They often provide you with important details you may overlook.
  3. **Consult anyone who will implement your decision.** The people who carry out your decisions may become your biggest enemies when you ignore their concerns, especially if they disagree with your decisions.
  4. **Aim for a consensus** if you can.

  4. **Decide.** If Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) blessed you with consensus, run with it. If not, be tough, and make a decision. _If there&#8217;s an overwhelming majority opinion, run with it inshaAllah_&#8211;even if you personally disagree with it.
  5. **Stick with it.** _Close the topic of discussion._  ****Do not let people open it again&#8211;they need to respect your authority, and you don&#8217;t want the issue to drag on and on and on forever every time someone thinks of something new. If you re-open it, be very, very sure it&#8217;s for a good reason.

May Allah bless our <span class="foreignWord">ummah</span> with a proper understanding and implementation of shura, ameen.
