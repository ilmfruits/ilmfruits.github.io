Eman has six pillars. To deny any one of the pillars, in part, or in whole, is the same as denying everything&#8211;it takes you out of Islam, and may Allah protect us all from that.

The pillars are:

  1. **Allah:** Believe that Allah, Lord of the Worlds, exists, and believe in his <dfn title="names and attributes">asmaa wal sifa</dfn>.
  2. **Books:** Believe in all the divine revelation, including the <dfn title="the Book of the Jews">Torah</dfn>, the <dfn title="The (pure) Gospel">Injeel</dfn>, and the Qur&#8217;an. They are really the same book (but now, the original Torah and Injeel no longer exist).
  3. **Angels:** Believe in the angels.
  4. **Prophets:** Believe in all the Prophets, from Adam (alayhi salaam), the first man and first prophet of Allah, to Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم), the seal of prophets, and everything in-between.
  5. **Qadr:** Believe in qadr (fate/predestination/free will)
  6. **Day of Judgement:** Believe in the Day of Judgement, and more generally, in the <dfn title="afterlife">akhira</dfn>.

Each of these pillars has more depth to them, but this is the general meaning. And I repeat: to deny any pillar (or any part of any pillar) is to leave Islam.

May Allah make us those who live and die on Islam. Ameen.
