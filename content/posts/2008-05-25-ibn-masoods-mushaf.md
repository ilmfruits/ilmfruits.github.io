Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (رضي الله عنه‏) is one of the most well-known companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). (Can someone suggest some good links that detail his biography?) Orientalists&#8211;who do not generally fabricate&#8211;claim that, prior to the Second Compilation, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood&#8217;s (رضي الله عنه‏) mushaf had _two extra surahs_ that our mushafs today don&#8217;t have. If you investigate this claim, you find that, indeed, it&#8217;s authentically report that his mushaf had two extra chapters.

So are these two &#8220;lost surahs&#8221; of the Qur&#8217;an, as they claim, that we don&#8217;t have anymore?

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur&#8217;an and indeed, We will be its guardian. \[Surah Al-Hijar, verse 9\] (And yes, the Arabic has three forms of emphasis in it.)

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has promised that He will protect the Qur&#8217;an. And whose promise is greater than His?

So when you search further in the authentic narrations&#8211;not surprisingly&#8211;what do you find? What were these two mysterious chapters?

Nothing more than du&#8217;a&#8211;authentically related du&#8217;a; one was dua-u-qunoot, for salaatul-witr.

(See how Orientalists twist things and slant things to make them look sinister?)

But this post is not about slamming Orientalists-some of them are good, some of them are neutral, and some of them are evil&#8211;just like any other group of people.

Rather, this post is about the mushaf of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (رضي الله عنه‏)&#8211;a mushaf which, even when the khalifa ordered him to give it up (as part of the Second Compilation), he refused&#8211;for a long time, he refused, until finally, he was convinced.

So why would he (رضي الله عنه‏) write du&#8217;a in his mushaf? Why not in another place?

There are a couple of reasons. First, paper (or, rather, parchment and similar materials) were very scarce&#8211;as was literacy&#8211;in the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). It was very hard to gather writing materials. Having a book was itself significant. So Ibn Mas&#8217;ood simply wrote du&#8217;a at the end of his mushaf.

But isn&#8217;t there a chance of confusion? People mixing Qur&#8217;an and ahadith together, in Arabic, in one book? No, not at all&#8211;companions knew which was Qur&#8217;an and which was not! So what was the harm in writing them in one book&#8211;especially considering the scarcity of materials?

And that, in a nutshell, is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood&#8217;s (رضي الله عنه‏) mushaf.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) protect us from doubts and whispers of Shaytaan and keep us firm in our eman and on our deen, ameen!
