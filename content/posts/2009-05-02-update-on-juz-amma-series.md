Bismillah.

We&#8217;ve been posting about tafseer of Juz &#8216;Amma for over a month now; and we&#8217;ve gone through about 10 surahs, walhamdulillah, and it seems like people are benefitting.

But &#8230; there are still 27 (!) surahs remaining. And as much as I would like to finish the series &#8230; it&#8217;s too long, by far, to have 37 posts on one series. Not to mention that it would take around 2 months.

So insha&#8217;Allah we&#8217;re going to do <del datetime="2009-05-05T15:27:41+00:00">five more posts, one per day all next week; we&#8217;ll finish with Surah Fil, and then, bi idhnillah, the series will be done.</del> **finish the series,** bi idhnillahi ta&#8217;ala, even if it takes a couple more months.

So if you have any feedback &#8230; now is the time to give it!

Wallahu musta&#8217;aan. We ask Allah to accept this effort from us (ameen!)
