Want to appreciate your parents more? Maybe give them the respect and honour they _really_ deserve? Here&#8217;s an easy way to do it!

Have you ever been in a position where someone did you a really big favour&#8211;big to you, anyway&#8211;and you really, **really** appreciated it? Think back in your life. Chances are you thanked the person _a lot_ for _days_ after it&#8211;and, what&#8217;s more, you changed the way you treated them.

Now think about one that includes your parents&#8211;some act of kindness they performed that really changed your life. Maybe they helped you with that Calculus assignment you thought you&#8217;d fail. Or bought you a nice car. Or helped you get married.

Thought of one? Good. Now, <span class="gem">realize that the deed they performed to help you out is but one in a long, long chain of deeds stretching back to before you were born.</span> Though you may not remember&#8211;or even see&#8211;everything they do, it started years before you even existed. They found you a good mom, and a good dad. They picked you a good name. Perhaps they even raised you on Islam. That in itself is an **amazing** blessing.

<span class="gem">So remember all those things they did and appreciate them the way they deserve.</span> And know that you can _never_ pay them back for everything they did for you.

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in the Qur&#8217;an**:**

<div class="quran">
  وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِندَكَ الْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلاَهُمَا فَلاَ تَقُل لَّهُمَآ أُفٍّ وَلاَ تَنْهَرْهُمَا <strong>وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلاً كَرِيمًا</strong>
</div>

<div class="quran">
  <strong>وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ</strong> وَقُل رَّبِّ ارْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِي صَغِيرًا
</div>

**Translation:** And your Lord commanded that you worship none but Him, and show kindness to your parents. If either or both of them reach old age with you, say not to them (so much as) &#8220;Ugh&#8221; nor chide them, **and address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy**, and say: My Lord! Have mercy on them both, as they cared for me when I was little. (Surah Al-Israa, 17:23-24)

So, what are you waiting for?
