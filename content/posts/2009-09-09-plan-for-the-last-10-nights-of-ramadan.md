Ramadan is coming to a close. Like the last half-kilometer of a 10km race, the finish-line is in sight. _This is the time to pull out all the stops and to sprint, flat-out._ This is the time when Laylatul-Qadar, the night where deeds are multiplied by _more_ than one thousand, hides.

Are _you_ ready for it?

Maybe you felt like Ramadan breezed by. Maybe you felt like you didn&#8217;t do enough. Well, _this is your chance to make up for it._ You need to finish strong, insha&#8217;Allah.

So **take five minutes and make an action plan.** This plan will, insha&#8217;Allah, help you milk the end of the month. Grab a piece of paper and write &#8220;Ramadan Plan&#8221; on it.

First, list two categories of historical items:

  * **The Good:** List all the things you did, that you&#8217;re happy with. You read Qur&#8217;an. You prayed Taraweeh. You donated $100. And so on. _You need to ensure you keep doing these things._
  * **The Bad:** Maybe you didn&#8217;t pray tahajjud. Maybe you didn&#8217;t even pray Fajr in the masjid! List all these things. Don&#8217;t hold back.

Then, create your action plan: **Pick as many items as you think you can handle, the best of The Good and whatever you can take from The Bad.** Using the example above, your action plan might include: Read Qur&#8217;an, pray Taraweeh, pray Fajr in the masjid.

Then, list **all the things you need to _stop doing_ to get this to work.** Maybe you watch 2-3 hours of TV a day. Or you spend six hours daily on Facebook. Whatever it is&#8211;list it, and aim to get rid of it.

It&#8217;s crucial to realize that **you need to sacrifice in the short-term.** You want to maximize Laylatul-Qadr. Do so, even if you&#8217;ll drop behind on things here and there for a few days.

Insha&#8217;Allah if you do this, you&#8217;ll have a strong, action-oriented plan for the last ten nights. And _remember to stretch yourself._ Go beyond your comfort limit. That&#8217;s what Ramadan is about&#8211;breaking the limits.

If you have any other tips, insha&#8217;Allah list them in the comments. I&#8217;d love to squeeze more benefit out of Laylatul-Qadr. May Allah give us all the tawfeeq to catch this awesome night with the best good deeds.
