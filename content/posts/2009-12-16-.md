<span style="color: #000000;">Narrated Abu Huraira: Some poor people came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;The wealthy people will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray like us and fast as we do. They have more money by which they perform the Hajj, and &#8216;Umra; fight and struggle in Allah&#8217;s Cause and give in charity.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you a thing upon which if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say &#8220;Sub-han-al-lah&#8221;, &#8220;Alhamdu-lillah&#8221; and &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; thirty three times each after every (compulsory) prayer.&#8221; We differed and some of us said that we should say, &#8220;Subhan-al-lah&#8221; thirty three times and &#8220;Alhamdu lillah&#8221; thirty three times and &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; thirty four times. I went to the Prophet who said, &#8220;Say, &#8220;Subhan-al-lah&#8221; and &#8220;Alhamdu lillah&#8221; and &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; all together for thirty three times.&#8221;  (Bukhari, Book <a href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/wp-admin/book_display.php?book=12&translator=1&start=0&number=804"><span style="color: #000000;">#12</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, Hadith </span><a href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/wp-admin/book_display.php?book=12&translator=1&start=0&number=804#804"><span style="color: #000000;">#804</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">)</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Action Item:</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everytime you say &#8216;SubhanAllah&#8217; recall the signs of Allah &#8211; the sun, the stars, the moon, the trees, human creation &#8212; and glorify His name. Glorify His name, Exalt Him subhana, knowing with certainty that Allah is above having partners and this sign is a certainty of His oneness and majesty</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everytime you say &#8216;Alhamdolilah&#8217; recall all the things you can be thankful to Allah for and praise Him rightfully as He deserves.</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everytime you say &#8216;Allahuakber&#8217; recall all the things that preoccupy your time &#8212; friends, family, spouses, kids, job, money, television &#8212; and proclaim His greatness above those things. Proclaim with certainty that Allah is far greater than all those things.</span></span>
