  We go through our entire lives looking for that perfect investment; whether it be our education, our jobs or our wealth. We put in so much time to gather information and to make sure that our investment will yield a satisfying return. In the end though, there is no certainty of the return on investment that we will gain, it could be 5%, 10%, or even -10%. We never know whether we will gain or lose from the investment that we make.

  However, there is an alternative. The alternative is investing in the deen of Allah (سبحانه وتعال). In this investment, you will <em>never lose</em>, and that is the promise of Allah (سبحانه وتعال). As we all know, Allah (سبحانه وتعال) is the one who never breaks any promise and He is The One and Only that we can count on. So, when He (سبحانه وتعال) promises something, you can consider it a done deal.

<div class="quran">
  مَّن ذَا الَّذِي يُقْرِضُ اللّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافاً كَثِيرَةً وَاللّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْسُطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ
</div>

  <strong><em>Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that gives (you) Want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return. &#8211; [Surah Baqarah, 2:245]</em> </strong>
