After the battle of Uhud, &#8216;Aisha (رضالله عنها) lost her necklace; so while the Muslim army moved forward, she stayed behind to find it. The army had a lost-and-found guy&#8211;Sawfan ibn Mu&#8217;atib (رضالله عنه)&#8211;who travelled behind the army and picked up lost items. So when he saw her, he immediately said **la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah** (there is no might or power except Allah), hopped off his camel, and let her go on it. _Not one word_ passed between them (as they narrated later).

When they reached Medina, rumors sprang up: &#8216;Aisha and Sawfan committed zina. Rumours by Abdullah ibn Ubay, the chief of the hypocrites.

Four groups emerged during this great fitnah&#8211;a fitnah where people offered to kill Sawfan. A fitnah where the Messenger of Allah himself (صلي الله عليه وسلم) drew back from his wife, unsure what to do. (Though Allah revealed verses confirming her innocence, after a month.) Who were these four groups?

  1. **Gossip-Mongers:** one group actively took it upon themselves to spread the vicious rumors (and they even knew it was false).
  2. **Echoers:** one group didn&#8217;t believe in it, but they still passed it on to others, anyway&#8211;and so word spread quickly.
  3. **The Silent Ones:** one group remained silent. Completely. They didn&#8217;t say she did it, they didn&#8217;t say she didn&#8217;t do it; they side-stepped the fitnah.
  4. **Deniers:** one group&#8211;even though they had no evidence&#8211;denied it. Some said &#8220;we only know good of Sawfan (رضالله عنه) and &#8216;Aisha (رضالله عنه).&#8221; And this is how Muslims _should_ be&#8211;husnul thunn, or giving our brothers and sisters the benefit of the doubt.

And Allah rebuked these groups, and revealed ayaat that Muslims should not pass on unconfirmed rumors, that they should think good of their brothers and sisters. The Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) even had people **_publicly lashed_** for spreading accusations without proof!

Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَاؤُوا بِالْإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنكُمْ لَا تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرّاً لَّكُم بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مِّنْهُم مَّا اكْتَسَبَ مِنَ الْإِثْمِ وَالَّذِي تَوَلَّى كِبْرَهُ مِنْهُمْ لَهُ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ<br /> لَوْلَا إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ ظَنَّ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بِأَنفُسِهِمْ خَيْراً وَقَالُوا هَذَا إِفْكٌ مُّبِينٌ<br /> لَوْلَا جَاؤُوا عَلَيْهِ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَاء فَإِذْ لَمْ يَأْتُوا بِالشُّهَدَاء فَأُوْلَئِكَ عِندَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْكَاذِبُونَ<br /> وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِي مَا أَفَضْتُمْ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ<br /> <strong>إِذْ تَلَقَّوْنَهُ بِأَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَتَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِكُم مَّا لَيْسَ لَكُم بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَتَحْسَبُونَهُ هَيِّناً وَهُوَ عِندَ اللَّهِ عَظِيم</strong>ٌ
</div>

**Translation:** Verily! Those who brought forth the slander (against &#8216;Aishah) [&#8230;] unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin [&#8230;]. Why then, did not the believers, men and women, when you heard it (the slander) think good of their own people and say: &#8220;This (charge) is an obvious lie?&#8221; [&#8230;] Since they (the slanderers) have not produced witnesses! Then with Allah they are the liars. [&#8230;] **When you were propagating it with your tongues, and uttering with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge, you counted it a little thing, while with Allah it was very great.** [Surah Noor, verses 11-15]

This happens today&#8211;you see a brother or sister at the mall walking with someone of the opposite sex. Or Muslims get arrested for purported acts of terrorism because they went paintballing once. But what should you do?

  1. **Default to a good opinion.** Innocent until proven very guilty. You&#8217;ll find that, most cases, you turn out to be right, and they really _were_ innocent.
  2. **Confirm a statement before you pass it on.** If it&#8217;s not confirmed when it reaches you, no problem; but **do confirm it** before you tell others about it.
  3. **Don&#8217;t get lashed!** Remember, the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) had them **_lashed_**&#8211;those who didn&#8217;t even believe it, but only passed it on! This is the level of enormity of the deed; remember it well.

And we ask Allah to make us among those who are safe from backbiting and slander, both to ourselves and to others (ameen)!
