<a title="Follow the Sunnah – Week 3" href="http://www.ilmfruits.com/follow-the-sunnah-week-3" target="_blank">Last week</a>, we focus on the sunnah of making ablution and coming out of the washroom. Here is the sunnah for this week:

**After the fard salahs:**

  * After slautation, say Allahu Akbar in loud voice
  * Say &#8220;Astagfirullah&#8221; thrice in low voice
  * Recite &#8220;Ayat Kursi&#8221;
  * <a href="http://dua.farhathashmi.com" target="_blank">Read the morning and evening supplications</a> after farjar and asar prayers (<a href="http://alhudapk.com/reading-material/duas/mornig_evening/default.asp" target="_blank">Another Link</a>)
  * <a href="http://makedua.com/display_dua.php?sectionid=25" target="_blank">Recite other Adhkars and Supplications</a>
  * Pray the two rakahs of ishraq after the fajar prayer (The Messenger of Allah [SAWS] said, “Whoever prays the dawn prayer (fajr) in a group and then sits and does dhikr until the sun rises, then prays two rakas, shall have the like of the reward of a hajj and an umra.”)

**Tip of the Week:**

Get some nice colorful cards/sticky notes. Put the relevant information and stick them in various places in the house as reminders.  For example, summarize the sunnahs about using the washroom that we have learnt in previous weeks, put it on the card and stick it on the washroom mirror or door.

**Action Item:**

  1. Share this post with 5 other people and get the ajar. Post on facebook, twitter, email etc
