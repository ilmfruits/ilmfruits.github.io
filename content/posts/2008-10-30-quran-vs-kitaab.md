Bismillah

The two most common names for the Book of Allah are: _Qur&#8217;an_ and _Kitaab_.

We learn when studying the Qur&#8217;an that even the words chosen are a revelation from Allah with divine wisdom. So, in that case, what do these two names mean and what is the difference between them?

The word &#8216;Qur&#8217;an&#8217; is said to be from two roots, one of them qaaf-ra-hamza, this root qara&#8217;a means to recite. So Qur&#8217;an would be: the Recital.

On the other hand, the word &#8216;Kitaab&#8217; is from kaaf-ta-ba which means something that is written.

If we look in the Qur&#8217;an, we see that Allah ta&#8217;ala uses different words to point to it:

<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">ذَ‌ٰلِكَ</span> الْكِتَابُ</span>

_<span style="color: #ff0000;">That </span>is the book!_ (2:2)

<span style="font-size: medium;">إِنَّ <span style="color: #ff0000;">هَذَا</span> الْقُرْآنَ</span>

_Indeed <span style="color: #ff0000;">this</span> Qur&#8217;an._ (27:76)

Why does Allah azza wa jal use &#8216;thaalika&#8217; for Kitaab and &#8216;haatha&#8217; for Qur&#8217;an?

_Thaalika_ is a word that is used to point to something far. The meaning of kitaab again is something WRITTEN, and the Kitaab&#8217;s ultimate written location is Lawh al Mahfoodh (The Preserved Tablet) with Allah ta&#8217;ala, so Allah ta&#8217;ala uses _thaalika_ to point to it because it is with Him above the seven heavens.

_Haatha_ is used to point to something that is close. The meaning of Qur&#8217;an is something that is recited, the recitation is taking place HERE, so Allah ta&#8217;ala uses a closer pointing word.

How about this ayah?

<span style="font-size: medium;">وَهَذَا كِتَابٌ </span>

_and this is a Book_. (6:92) Allah ta&#8217;ala uses _haatha_ (the close pointing word) for _Kitaab._ This is one place in the Qur&#8217;an where Allah ta&#8217;ala uses _haatha_ to point to the _Kitaab&#8230;_What&#8217;s the connection?

At the time of the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam, the Qur&#8217;an was not written as a book that we have nowadays&#8230;but of course Allah azza wa jal KNEW it would be in a book form one day, so He azza wa jal said: _this book,_ pointing to it as if it was close.

But to keep the rank and status of the Qur&#8217;an, and to dispel any doubts that it was written by a man, Allah ta&#8217;ala says right after:

<span style="font-size: medium;">وَهَذَا كِتَابٌ<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> أَنزَلْنَاهُ</span></span></span>

_And this is a Book, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We have sent it down</span></span>._ (6:92)

SubhanAllah!
