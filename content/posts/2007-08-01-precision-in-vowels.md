To give your recitation a quick boost, try &#8216;Itmaam-ul-Harakaat&#8217;. No, it&#8217;s not a medicine from Yemen. &#8216;Itmaam&#8217; simply means _completion_ & &#8216;harakaat&#8217; could be loosely translated to mean _vowels_. It means fine-tuning the vowels. Unlike English, unitary vowels in Arabic are not letters &#8211; thus not written out explicitly. Instead, they are shown with either of the following 3 marks above or below a letter.

**Fathah:** straight stroke on top of a letter, pronounced like the &#8216;a&#8217; as in &#8220;bat&#8221;. The common mistake is to pronounce it as the &#8216;a&#8217; in &#8220;ball&#8221;, thus making it heavy. Bear in mind that heavy letters are only a minority (7 of 28), so for most cases pick up the &#8220;bat&#8221; and throw the &#8220;ball&#8221; away. Trust me on this.

**Kasrah:** straight stroke below a letter, pronounced as the &#8216;e&#8217; in &#8220;bee&#8221; & not as the &#8216;ay&#8217; in &#8220;bay&#8221;. Say Bismillah. Go ahead, I&#8217;m waiting. See? Did you say &#8220;base&#8221;millah (really bad)? or &#8220;bes&#8221;millah (still wrong)? or &#8220;bis&#8221;millah(correct) as in &#8220;biscuit&#8221;?
  
Imagine it is night-time & you are standing at the shore of a &#8220;bay&#8221; when a &#8220;bee&#8221; attacks you from behind. You have two options: jump in the &#8220;bay&#8221; or fight the &#8220;bee&#8221;. Well, if you are carrying the &#8220;bat&#8221; from the first vowel, you can easily fight the &#8220;bee&#8221;.

**Dammah:** looks almost like a &#8216;9&#8217; & found above the letter. It is pronounced as the &#8216;oo&#8217; in &#8220;moon&#8221;. This requires that your lips make a complete circle as they extend outwards. Try imitating Lifesavers. Don&#8217;t eat &#8217;em though &#8211; not halal. Anyways, whatever you do, don&#8217;t pronounce it like the &#8216;o&#8217; in &#8220;moan&#8221;. Hence, the spelling &#8216;Mohammed&#8217; is wrong. It should really be &#8216;Muhammed&#8217;.

So after fighting the &#8220;bee&#8221; with your &#8220;bat&#8221;, you look at the beautiful &#8220;moon&#8221; and praise Allah. For either the &#8220;ball&#8221; or the &#8220;bay&#8221; would have had you &#8220;moan&#8221;ing right now.
