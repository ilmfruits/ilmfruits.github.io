Those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of the [AlMaghrib institute][1], you&#8217;re missing out&#8211;they give some mashallah _amazing_ double-weekend Islamic classes.

[Qabeelat Majd][2] (QMajd) is the Toronto branch. Mashallah, through the dedicated efforts of some dozen or so people, they finally published [their first newsletter][3]! It&#8217;s for the [Rules of Engagement][4] class (click to learn more about the class), so it covers the subject of akhlaaq&#8211;manners, etiquettes, dealings with Allah, with people, with yourself&#8211;and contains such fruitful topics as:

  * As Cool As Ice
  * Khushu in Salah: Obstacles and Solutions
  * One Good Deed
  * Changing Habits
  * Changing Habits
  * Sheikh Ahmad and the Backbiting Bint
  * And many more ilm-ified pieces, including a crossword!

Inshallah **[read it now][5]** and benefit your own eman and akhlaaq tremendously! May Allah reward all their efforts and keep them steadfast on the deen, ameen!
