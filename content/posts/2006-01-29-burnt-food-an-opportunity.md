Common reactions among many types of people when their spouse burns their food, or forgets the salt, or oversalts, or otherwise destroys it, are statements such as &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with you, don&#8217;t you know how to cook&#8221; and &#8220;didn&#8217;t your mother/father ever teach you anything&#8221; and so on.

Remain patient, as the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) remained when his wives cooked food he didn&#8217;t like. He sat, and said nothing at all, nor did he eat from it.

Realize the person is more important than the meal, and take the opportunity to say to yourself &#8220;You know what, this person and their feelings are more important&#8211;it&#8217;s ok, it&#8217;s just burnt food.&#8221; Positive and encouraging statements correct painlessly. Acknowledge the effort, regardless of the results.

May Allah grant us all wisdom in our da&#8217;wah and patience in our afflictions.
