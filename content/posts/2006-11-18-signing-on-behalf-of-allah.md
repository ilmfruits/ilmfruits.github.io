<p class="gem">
  Never, ever, EVER say such-and-such is haram/halal/fard/etc. without knowledge. To say so, is to sign on behalf of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). And who dares to do that without knowledge?
</p>

This is the job of the <dfn title="those who make ijtihad">mujtahiduwn</dfn> &#8212; those who research fiqh issues and then issue <dfn title="plural of fatwa">fatawa</dfn>. Notice, the best of them _always_ say, &#8220;this is the final ruling, and Allah knows best.&#8221; Why? Because they **are signing on behalf of Allah** (سبحانه وتعالى). They are really saying, &#8220;Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and his Messenger (صلي الله عليه وسلم), _want you to perform/avoid this action_.

But that&#8217;s not all. If they say something is haram, they&#8217;re saying: **Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)** **may punish you for doing this action!** Same with fard: **Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)** **will reward you for this action (if done sincerely)!** Do you dare sign something on Allah&#8217;s behalf, when you don&#8217;t know?

This is why many scholars, as well, use the makrooh category when they don&#8217;t know for sure something is haram. Like smoking&#8211;originally, scholars thought &#8220;yeah, it gives you bad breath &#8230; seems a little fishy but &#8230; Allahu &#8216;alim, it&#8217;s <dfn title="Allah hates it">makrooh</dfn>.&#8221; And as soon as they learned it causes so many diseases&#8211;emphysema, lung cancer, etc. &#8212; _instant downgrade to haram_. Because harming your body is unethical and unislamic. But **out of their taqwa of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)****, they didn&#8217;t say so in the first place&#8211;not without solid, 110% assurity.** So how can we say such things, without even a tenth of their knowledge?

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) protect us from a tongue that carries us into the Hellfire, ameen.

If you didn&#8217;t know, then alhamdulillah, now you do. Be careful in the future inshallah. The best thing to say is, &#8220;such-and-such a scholar/imam/book/etc. says that x action has y ruling, and Allah knows best.&#8221; But don&#8217;t sign on behalf of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)!

Subhanallah. Imagine a guy who pretends he&#8217;s a surgeon. Fakes his documents, and someone hires him. An emergancy case rushes in&#8211;they need him to operate. So the guy hits up Google: &#8220;brain surgery 101&#8243;. And suppose he actually operated, successfully&#8211;saved the patient&#8217;s life.

Now, if they found out about his forged credentials after the fact, what do you think they&#8217;d do to him? Do you think his employers would say, &#8220;good job dude, here&#8217;s a nice chunk of salary, _and_ a nice bonus for saving that guy&#8217;s life?&#8221; No way! They&#8217;d probably haul him to jail (and the patient would sue)!

Now imagine the opposite&#8211;totally skilled master surgeon has a bad day, and actually kills his patient. (People make mistakes.) What&#8217;s going to happen? Are they going to fire him? Maybe. But definitely, he still gets his salary.

Similarly, for <dfn title="applying the tools and processes to discover the ruling on a particular action/item">ijtihad</dfn>, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, the reward for one who makes ijtihad (properly&#8211;using all the tools, techniques, and the sciences) and _makes a mistake,_ is one reward (basic salary); and for one who makes ijtihad (properly) and is correct, is two rewards (salary _and_ a bonus!).

So make the smart decision&#8211;don&#8217;t play with peoples deen. That&#8217;s what we do when we sign on behalf of Allah. Keep silent if you don&#8217;t know, and quote your sources. Remember, **this is their deen you&#8217;re messing with&#8211;their eternal and un-ending akhira life at stake.** Don&#8217;t risk it!

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) grant us all perfect knowledge of this perfect and beautiful deen of Islam, ameen!
