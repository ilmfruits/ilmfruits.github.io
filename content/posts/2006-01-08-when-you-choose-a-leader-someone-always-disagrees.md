  When you choose a leader, someone always disagrees with you.
</p>

No matter who you are and who your leader is, you cannot please everyone. So get used to it inshaAllah.

During the time of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) chose &#8216;Usama ibn Zayd (son of Zayid ibn Thabit, may Allah be pleased with them both) as the leader of the army. And they had high-status alumni sahaba in that army, like &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab (radiallahu &#8216;anh), who was in his 40s or so.

And people argued with the Prophet.

So take heart: **even if your leader is a sahabi and the sahaba follow him, someone will disagree with the decision.** So don&#8217;t get hung up on it, and pick the best leader inshaAllah based on his merits.

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
