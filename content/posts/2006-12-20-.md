&#8220;And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of Allah&#8217;s obedience as a favour to Allah).&#8221; [Surah Al-Muddathir, Verse 6]

Ibn \`Abbas said, &#8220;Do not give any gift seeking to get (back in return) more than it.&#8221; Khusayf reported from Mujahid: (And give not a thing (Tamnun) in order to have more.) &#8220;Do not slacken in seeking more good. **Tamnun** in the language of the Arabs means **to become weak**.&#8221; Subhanallaah, to desire more back is to become weak. Lets reflect upon it, why should desiring more back make us weak? From _whom_ do we _expect_ to recieve more? The person we did the deed towards? Did we do the deed to please that person or Allah? If we ponder upon the significance of desiring something back from our actions, we will realize that it is only Allah whom we should rely upon and desire from. And Allah is the best in providing.
  
Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement:

(And be patient for the sake of your Lord!) meaning, make your patience with their harms be for the Face of your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. This was stated by Mujahid. Ibrahim An-Nakha\`i said, &#8220;Be patient in your giving for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.&#8221;
