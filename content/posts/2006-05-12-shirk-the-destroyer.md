Most of the ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that are directed to non-Muslims, are directed to mushrikeen&#8211;those who commit <dfn title="those who set up partners with Allah, in thought or deed">shirk</dfn>. In fact, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) spells out, in **painful** detail, just how dangerous shirk is. Read and remember.

<div class="miniTitle">
  The Unforgivable Sin
</div>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, in Surah Nisaa:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا
</div>

**Translation:** Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin. ([Surah Nisaa][1], verse 48)<sup>1</sup>

What does this means? It means if you commit an act of shirk and die on it, _Allah will punish you for it_. What else does it mean? _Allah may forgive any sin smaller then shirk_. Anything in Islam is potentially forgivable. Even murder. Subhanallah.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Forbidden from Paradise
</div>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, in Surah Maida:

<div class="quran">
  لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَقَالَ الْمَسِيحُ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اعْبُدُواْ اللّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللّهُ عَلَيهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ وَمَا لِلظّ
</div>

**Translation:** Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong­doers) there are no helpers. ([Surah Maida][2], verse 72)<sup>1</sup>

That&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s not &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll enter the Hellfire for a few days, then we&#8217;re cool&#8221; (as the Jews used to say); rather, entrance into Hellfire will be **permanent**, as in **forever**, as in **an infinite number of days**. May Allah protect us.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Destroys a Lifetime of Good Deeds
</div>

One act of shirk is _so evil_ that it destroys a _lifetime_ of sins. No other sin is like that. Check out what Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in Surah Zumar:

<div class="quran">
  وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** And indeed it has been revealed to you [the Prophet], as it was to those [prophets] before you: &#8220;If you join others in worship with Allah, then surely all your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the <dfn title="losers; those destined for Hell">khasirin</dfn>.&#8221; ([Surah Zumar][3], verse 65)<sup>1</sup>

What&#8217;s more, tafseer of this verse reveals the following:

  1. **The verse is addressed to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم)****.** Nobody has more good deeds then he does. And if _his_ good deeds can be waived&#8230;
  2. **His past and present sins were forgiven.** But still, after all that, if he commits shirk&#8230;
  3. **Emphasis.** Just like if you said to someone &#8220;look, I&#8217;m _telling_ you&#8221;, Allah uses emphasis in this verse.
  4. **People before you.** They are mentioned here for emphasis.
  5. **Prophets can&#8217;t commit major sins.** So why was this verse revealed to him? To make us understand the gravity of shirk.

And remember, even though this verse was addressed to the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), it was intended for us to understand and follow as well.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Can&#8217;t Ask For Forgiveness
</div>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, in Surah Tawbah:

<div class="quran">
  مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُواْ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ أُوْلِي قُرْبَى مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَابُ الْجَحِيمِ
</div>

**Translation:** It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief). ([Surah Tawbah][4], verse 113)<sup>1</sup>

This verse was revealed in the context of the Prophet&#8217;s uncle, Abu Talib, who protected him until his death. The Prophet said: &#8220;I will ask forgiveness for you until I am forbidden to do so,&#8221; and this verse came down.<sup>2</sup>

Now think about that verse. The person who commits zina _loses his head_, but they bring his body in, pray his janaazah, ask Allah to forgive him, and then bury him.

But not so for shirk. You die on shirk, you die a non-Muslim.

May Allah protect us all from the evils of shirk, in our intentions and our actions, ameen.
