One of the fundamental war techniques of Khalid bin Walid (radiallahu &#8216;anh) is that he <span class="gem">never wasted time</span>. He might make mistakes from it, but he moved the entire army at the speed of a single rider. Most armies crawl at a slow pace, but his army moved quickly. The Muslims were all very well disciplined. If you were in his army, you moved fast.

He moved so quickly that after one battle took place at one village, before the defenders regrouped, he arrived at the next village and attacked. While they regrouped, he moved to the next village and attacked. While they said &#8220;let&#8217;s have meetings and decide what to do,&#8221; he&#8217;s already _on your back and throwing you down._

When one of the Muslim generals in Ash-Sham, Iyaad ibn ibn Ghanam (RA) sent Khalid bin Walid (radiallahu &#8216;anh) a letter requesting aid, he got a reply: &#8220;You&#8217;re my destination.&#8221; He looked up, and saw the Muslim army on the horizon.

Khalid bin Walid (radiallahu &#8216;anh) never, never lost a battle. Not before Islam, when he fought the Muslims, and not after Islam. May Allah guide us with his example, ameen.
