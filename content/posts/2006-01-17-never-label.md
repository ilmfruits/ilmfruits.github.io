<p class="gem">
  Never label. Human beings are not two-dimensional that you can slap a label onto them and classify them.
</p>

One of the best ways to destroy ties between people, groups, and organizations is to label them. _Even_ if they deserve it, don&#8217;t do it.

When you find yourself applying a label to someone, ask yourself: Will this action please Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)?

When you find others who label, back away. You don&#8217;t want to involve yourself with people like that.
  
During the time of &#8216;Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, the dissenters labeled him. They said &#8220;&#8216;Uthman doesn&#8217;t follow the sunnah,&#8221; a common label we find today. And what happened? It culmulated with his death.

May Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) protect us from destroying each other, intentionally or unintentionally, ameen.
