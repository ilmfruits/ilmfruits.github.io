excerpt: "What's the difference between fard and wajib?  Allah knows best, the majority of scholars say there IS no difference.  In the Hanafi madhab, they differentiate; one report is that neglecting one makes you a non-Muslim, while neglecting the other doesn't.  One report is that fard is for Qur'anic commands and wajib is for sunnah commands.  Allah knows best--in the end, they're the same thing."

A lot of people&#8211;especially new Muslims&#8211;break their heads on this conundrum. What is the difference between fard and wajib? Are they the same? Are they different? What&#8217;s the scoop? Why do some people say fard, while others say wajib for the same things?

The answer is simple. According to the majority of scholars, <span class="gem">fard and wajib mean the EXACT same thing.</span> There is no difference. They are interchangable. (Recall that fard means: an action that, if performed, entails reward, and if neglected, entails punishment.)

However&#8211;there is one exception. The Hanafi madhab differentiates between the two. They say that **denying a fard makes you kafir,** while **denying a wajib does not**. Note that here, we&#8217;re talking about _denying_ an action, not neglecting it&#8211;so if someone says, &#8220;no, I don&#8217;t have to pray, **prayer is not obligatory**,&#8221; that&#8217;s denying a fard, while someone else who says &#8220;yes, prayer is obligatory but I don&#8217;t feel like praying,&#8221; is sinning (major sin).

In the end, it&#8217;s like saying &#8220;forest&#8221; or &#8220;trees&#8221;&#8211;some say fard, and some say wajib, but they&#8217;re the same thing.

And Allah, Al-Aleem, knows best. We ask Allah to increase us in knowledge that will benefit us and protect us from knowledge that has no benefit, ameen ya rabbi!
