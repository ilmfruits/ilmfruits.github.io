Bismillah walhamdolilah wasalatu wasalam &#8216;ala Rasool Allah

Asalamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatahu,

Allah has revealed His Speech, the Qur&#8217;an as a source of guidance for mankind and the Ummah of Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wasalam will not gain their dignity back until we return back to it. We ask Allah to allow us to return to His Speech in these times of tribulation and seek guidance from it. Ameen.

Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an:

يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَن يَرْتَدَّ مِنكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِي اللّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ يُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ وَلاَ يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لآئِمٍ ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَاءُ وَاللّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ

O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the Way of Allah, and never afraid of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is All Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All Knower

[Surah Ma&#8217;ida V. 54]

[يَا]

Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala could have started this verse off without this yaa. However, Allah uses it to show His care, compassion, and mercy as is the case when Luqman uses it when giving advice to His son:

وَإِذْ قَالَ لُقْمَانُ لِابْنِهِ وَهُوَ يَعِظُهُ يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ

Behold, Luqman said to his son by way of instruction: &#8220;O my son! join not in worship (others) with Allah: for false worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing.&#8221;

[Surah Luqman V.13]

Or when Yaqub used it to address his son Yusuf alayhuma salam:

قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْداً إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ

He (the father) said: &#8220;O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you. Verily! Shaitan (Satan) is to man an open enemy!

[Surah Yusuf V.5]

[يُحِبُّهُمْ ]

Truly, it is the quality of love, mercy and compassion that will change the hearts of people. Our beloved Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam was a man of great mercy and compassion to all of mankind and he was a man who loved the believers. Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an:

وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ

And We have not sent you except as a mercy for the &#8216;Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists)

[Surah al-Anbiya V.107]

In the sahih collection of Imam Bukhari rahimuhallah, Al-Hassan radhiAllah anhu narrates from Anas ibn Malik radhiAllah anhu that the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam said in regards to the incident of intercession: &#8220;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate before Him me the same as before and He will say: &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&#8217; Then Allah will say, &#8216;By my Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell (Fire) whoever said: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8217; &#8221;

SubhanAllah, this is proof of the love our beloved sallalahu alayhi wasalam had for all believers.

Bringing the guidance of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam into our lives, its neccessary moving forward that we be a people of mercy towards mankind and a people of love towards the believers. True love leads to mercy and this is what we need right now in these difficult times; we need to come together as an ummah and truly love eachother, care for eachother, and protect eachother as brothers and sisters in Islam.

To expand on this, Imam Muslim rahimuhallah reports that Tamim al-Dari radhiAllah anhu narrated that the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wasalam said: &#8220;Religion is nasihah.&#8221;
