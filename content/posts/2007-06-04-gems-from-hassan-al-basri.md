Umar Ibn Hubayra Al-Fazari was the governor of Iraq in the period of the Khilafa of Yazid Ibn Abdul-Malik of the Bani Umayyah. Hassan Ibn Yasar Al-Basri once came to the court of Umar Ibn Hubayra and said to him:

&#8220;O Ibn Hubayra! Fear Allah when you obey Yazid, and do not fear Yazid when you obey Allah. Know that Allah will protect you from Yazid, but Yazid can not protect you from Allah (سبحانه وتعال)

&#8220;O Ibn Hubayra! **You are waiting for the angel of death, who will take you from the vast wideness of your palace to a narrow and a short grave.** Yazid will not be there in your grave. You will find your deeds that you disobeyed the Lord of Yazid with. 

&#8220;O Ibn Hubayra! If you are with Allah, Allah will protect you from Yazid, but if you are with Yazid, then Allah will leave you to rely on Yazid.&#8221;

Umar Ibn Hubayra then started crying until his beard was soaked with tears.
