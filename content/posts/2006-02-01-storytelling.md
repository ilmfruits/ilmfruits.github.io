  Storytelling is a fundamental da&#8217;wah technique. It effortlessly communicates a message in a memorable medium.
</p>

Storytelling is so powerful that you see it in the Qur&#8217;an (Surah Baqarah and Surah Yusuf, for example), in ahadith ([The People of the Ditch][1]).

Among the benefits: storytelling communicates a message without spelling it out. Human beings recall stories more easily then they recall other forms of teaching. With a story, you can continually extract lessons and benefit from it.

**Use stories in your da&#8217;wah**&#8211;in your khutbas, your books and your literature, your speeches and your discussions.
