Ihsaan is not perfection, it&#8217;s excellence. Strive your best, but tolerate mistakes as well. Only Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is perfect.

Don&#8217;t be like the shopkeeper who keeps the door to his shop closed all the time in order to keep it clean. No customers enter. If you&#8217;re always closed and looking for perfection, you&#8217;ll shut down.

When in doubt, kick-start your project as &#8220;Version 1.0&#8243; and build on it.

I ask Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to help us all execute our projects to bring benefit to the people, ameen.
