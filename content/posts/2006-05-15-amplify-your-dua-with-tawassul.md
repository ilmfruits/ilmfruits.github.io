What is Tawassul? **Linguistically**, it means _that which brings you closer_ to an object. The Arabic is tawassul (توسّل) or wasiylah (وسيلة). **Islamically**, it means any good deed that _brings you closer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى)_&#8211;so _every single good deed_ can be called tawassul&#8211;though scholars use it specifically to mean things that increase our chances of having our du&#8217;a accepted.

The Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah only sanction four types of tawassal (with a difference of opinion on the fifth). These are the _only_ acceptable types of tawassul. They are:

<div class="miniTitle">
  Tawassul with Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes
</div>

There is hardly a du&#8217;a mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah without mention of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), His names, or His attributes. And the most common name mentioned is ar-rabb (the Lord)&#8211;why? Because the rabb is the sustainer, the nourisher, the provider. You call out to the Rabb, and He gives you what you need.

And we _should_ invoke Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) with His names and attributes. Because Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) himself says:

<div class="quran">
  وَلِلّهِ الأَسْمَاء الْحُسْنَى فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا وَذَرُواْ الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَآئِهِ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so **call on Him by them** [[Surah Al-Araaf][1], verse 180]<sup>1</sup>.

So make du&#8217;a with Allah&#8217;s names and attributes. If you want forgiveness, use Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, At-Tawab, and so on. For sustance, use Ar-Razaq, Al-Kareem, etc. Make du&#8217;a with **appropriate** names and attributes suitable to your request. (You can always try &#8220;O Allah, you are the only one who responds to du&#8217;a &#8230;&#8221;)

(For an excellent Flash video containing Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, see [this link][2].)

<div class="miniTitle">
  Tawassul with One&#8217;s State (Past/Present/Future)
</div>

When Prophet Zakariya makes du&#8217;a for a child, he says &#8220;O Allah, I have never been unfortunate with responding to my du&#8217;as&#8221; (i.e. that the previous ones have all been answered). That is, he makes tawassul with his present state.

Similarly, when Prophet Musa is in Midian, all alone, with no idea where he&#8217;s going, and he sees the two ladies and helps them feed his flock, he says &#8220;O Allah, I am a beggar to your good&#8221;. That is, he makes tawassul with his present state.

(If you know the ayat with these du&#8217;a, please post them in a comment. Jazakumullahu khayr.)

So make tawassul with your present state. It puts a very personal touch to your du&#8217;a. &#8220;O Allah, look at my pathetic state &#8230;&#8221; Or, to make tawassul with your future state, try something like &#8220;O Allah, I will use XYZ for some good &#8230;&#8221;

<div class="miniTitle">
  Tawassul with Your Deeds
</div>

There&#8217;s the hadith about the three people trapped in the cave by the boulder&#8211;&#8220;They said to each other, &#8216;Invoke Allah **with the best deed you have performed** (so Allah might remove the rock)&#8217;.&#8221; [Bukhari [3/34/418][3]]<sup>2</sup>

One made du&#8217;a and referred to his kindness to parents, one mentioned zakaah, and one mentioned the wages he paid a worker in full&#8211;and after each du&#8217;a, the boulder that trapped them moved a little more, until all three made du&#8217;a and they were freed.

In our times, if you gave money to charity or a good cause, or something similar, you can use that&#8211;&#8220;O Allah, I am in need of Your rizq. That beggar I helped, if You know I did it for You, heed my request.&#8221; Apply similarly to fit your situation and needs.

<div class="miniTitle">
  Tawassul with Du&#8217;a of a Living Person
</div>

If you know someone who you believe, is more pious then you, ask them: &#8220;hey, make du&#8217;a for me inshallah.&#8221; The sahaba did it (as did the scholars), so it&#8217;s definitely valid. **However**, the condition is that you don&#8217;t assume the du&#8217;a _will_ be accepted for 100% sure&#8211;there&#8217;s just a better chance.

And of course, you yourself don&#8217;t forget to make du&#8217;a. And realize **the one in distress has a better chance of having his du&#8217;a accepted**.

One guy went to a scholar and said &#8220;I am in distress, make du&#8217;a for me,&#8221; to which the scholar said &#8220;in that case, make it yourself &#8212; Allah responds to the one in distress.&#8221; The person in distress will have much more sincerity when they make that du&#8217;a.

And that&#8217;s Tawassul. Try these methods in your du&#8217;a inshallah, and you&#8217;ll **feel** the difference yourself, especially in your sincerity of du&#8217;a.
