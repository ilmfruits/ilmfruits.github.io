In the fast-paced world we live in, we often lose the righteousness needed to attain the closeness to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) that we desire. We go through constant struggles, fighting with ourselves to do what is good and to stay on The Straight Path. At times we prosper and succeed, but much of the time, we lose the fight, but why? Why do we succumb to the temptations of this world? Why do we reject the beauty that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has provided us for the corruption of this dunya? The answer is not easy, as there are many reasons.

The first thing we must understand is that falling down and losing is an absolute natural process that we all go through as human beings. The important thing is to learn from these losses; get up, dust yourself off, and move forward stronger than before.

One critical reason why we become weak in staying on The Straight Path and staying away from that which Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has commanded us to stay away from is our _friends._ Our friends can be the reason we enter _Jannah_ and they could also be the reason that we are destined to <dfn title="Hellfire">Jahannam.</dfn> The choice is ours to make. We have been given the choice to choose our friends wisely, and the result of it could be the pleasure of seeing our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) and Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) in _Jannah_ or being flung into the scorching hot flames of <dfn title="Hellfire">Jahannam</dfn>. **What do you desire?**

In an authentic hadith, Prophet Mohammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: _&#8220;A person is likely to follow the faith of his friend, so look whom you befriend.&#8221;_

Our dear guide and the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) is warning us that we are who our friends are. Now this lesson might take some time for us to realize, but it is true. In the quoted hadith, the word _faith_ speaks of the characteristics, morals, values, and beliefs of the people you befriend. Now, some people might deny that they are influenced by their friends, but it is their own self-denial. As Muslims, we have the duty and right to make sure that the environment is developed adhering to the commands of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and therefore it is a must that we choose friends that will bring us closer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and get us one step closer towards Jannah. Think to yourself, am I more aware of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) when I am around my friends? or less aware? am I more obedient to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) when I am around my friends? or less obedient? If I were to die while hanging with my friends would I go to Jannah? Jahannam?

Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said, _&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad one is the bearer of musk and the worker on the fires. A bearer of musk would give you some, you might buy some from him, or you might enjoy the fragrance of his musk. The worker on the fires, on the other hand, might spoil your clothes with sparks from his bellows, or you get a bad smell from him.&#8221;_ [Bukhari and Muslim]

Subhanallah! What a great example given to us by our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). This hadith articulates in such a precise manner the difference between the good companion and the bad companion. Ponder about this hadith and look to your own life, and make it a point starting **TODAY** to be of those who are recipients of the _beautiful fragrance of musk_ rather than _sparks of a dangerous fire_. Remember, we are only risking our own life when we choose to befriend people who do not follow the ways of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and our beloved Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). On the Day of Judgment, no one will be at your aid, and it will be you and you alone in front of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى), and on that Day no one will be responsible for what you did in this life except for yourself.

**Still don&#8217;t believe me? Still having doubts? Try the steps below.**

  * Who are the top five people you hang out with? List them.
  * Now look at their qualities (good and bad) and you&#8217;ll notice that you are a product of the sum of them.
  * Are you a product of their good qualities? bad qualities? Do they have the outstanding qualities that you seek?
  * If they do not have the outstanding qualities you need, then it&#8217;s time to find some bearers of musk that you can truly smell great from.
  * This doesn&#8217;t mean to completely abandon them, but rather distance yourself so you can cleanse yourself of the fire and bad smells that they have left upon you!

  <strong>Put yourself and your life to account now, before you are held to account by Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). Choose your friends carefully and they will lead you to the gates of Jannah, Inshallah ta&#8217;ala.</strong>
