Bismillah.

We all know that we should pray tahajjud, aka qiyaam-ul-layl. It&#8217;s well established in the deen that this is a very, very rewarding thing to do (but it&#8217;s not fard, so don&#8217;t sweat it if you&#8217;re not doing it). Some motivational factors for this include:

  * The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to pray Qiyaam-ul-Layl until his legs swelled. When asked why&#8211;since Allah has forgiven **_all his past and future sins, he said: Should I not be a grateful slave? [Agreed Upon]_**
  * Do you have goals you&#8217;re trying to achieve? Is there something you really, really want? **_Are you willing to pray Qiyam and cry in front of Allah for it?_** Because nothing will turbo-charge your success like Qiyam.
  * On the day of Judgment, Allah will ask about YOUR salah. If it&#8217;s not 100% perfect, **_He will not even LOOK at your other deeds._** BUT! If your Fard salaah is not perfect, Allah will patch it up with your nafl and sunnah prayers&#8211;including Qiyaam-ul-Layl. [There&#8217;s a hadith related to this recorded in the collection of At-Tabari]

So what are some creative, unorthodox, unusual timers you use to wake you up? Share it in the comments! Some of the one&#8217;s I&#8217;ve seen (that are effective) are:

  1. **Crying Babies:** If there&#8217;s a young child in your family (under two years), chances are they wake up crying in the night. Take advantage of this&#8211;get up and pray!
  2. **Bad Dreams:** In one narration, the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said that if you have a bad dream, you should wake up and pray. Shaytan will get discouraged from sending you more bad dreams&#8211;because it&#8217;s resulting in you doing MORE good deeds!
  3. **Drink Water:** Drink lots of water&#8211;about a liter. You will FOR SURE have to wake up to use the washroom in the night. Make wudoo&#8217; while you&#8217;re at it!

What are some other creative, useful, effective methods you use to wake up for Qiyaam?
