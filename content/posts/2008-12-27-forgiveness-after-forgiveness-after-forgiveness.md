There&#8217;s a beautiful du&#8217;a that Allah mentions near the end of Surah Baqarah:

<div class="quran">
  وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا
</div>

**Translation:** So do &#8216;affuw on us. And forgive us. And have mercy on us. [Surah Baqarah, verse 286]

Allah mentions three things, in order:

  1. **&#8216;Affuw &#8216;annaa**: Affuw linguistically means to erase something; to obliterate something; to completely destroy something and leave no traces of it whatsoever. This du&#8217;a is saying: make affuw of our sins. Remove them completely.
  2. **Waghfir lanaa:** Ghafira linguistically means to protect&#8211;that&#8217;s why a helmet is called a mighfaar. Read up about Allah&#8217;s two names: Al-Ghafuwr and Al-Ghaffaar. Here, the du&#8217;a is saying: and if you do not &#8216;affuw our sins, forgive us, and protect us from the consequences of them.
  3. **Warham naa:** Rahmah is mercy; Allah has two names related to this quality&#8211;Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem. Here, the du&#8217;a is saying: and if you do not even forgive our sins, then have mercy on us! Subhanallah!

What an amazing du&#8217;a! Do affuw of our sins; and if not, forgive us and protect us from their effects; and if not, have mercy on us!

THAT&#8217;S your Lord!

**Action Items:**

  * **Memorize this verse.** It&#8217;s a bit long, but it&#8217;s worth it. [[link][2]]
  * **Read up about the names of Allah.** Read about Al-Affuw, Al-Ghafuwr, Al-Ghaffaar, Ar-Rahman, and Ar-Raheem.
  * **Use this du&#8217;a.** Whenever you commit a sin, follow it up with istighfaar, and some good deeds, and use this du&#8217;a; recite it in your sujood, during tawarruk (sitting) after you&#8217;ve done all your other du&#8217;as, you can say ANY du&#8217;a you want (in Arabic only!). So memorize this du&#8217;a and use it! </ul> 
    Wallahu &#8216;alim.
