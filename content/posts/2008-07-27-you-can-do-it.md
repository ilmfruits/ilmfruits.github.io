My brothers and sisters in Islam, know that the Muslim is one who never gives up in anything that he or she does. O People! Know that the one who submits himself to Allah, should never feel like he or she does not have the capabilities to accomplish something.

My brothers and sisters, sometimes we find it difficult to excel in our fields. If you&#8217;re a student &#8212; you may feel that you&#8217;re not able to get that A+ grade, you think to yourself _&#8216;I&#8217;m not that smart, I can&#8217;t do it!&#8217;_. If you&#8217;re a worker &#8212; you may feel that your not able to get that amazing position in the company, you think to yourself _&#8216;I&#8217;m not qualified, I can&#8217;t do it!&#8217;_ 

O People! O Believers! Do you not know that Allah azza wa jal is able to do all things?

Abu Hurairah radhiAllah anhu narrates in a hadith that the Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam said: **&#8220;Seek out that which benefits you, seek help only from Allah and _never say you can&#8217;t do it_.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim]
  
** 

O Muslims! Do that which benefits you, put in your efforts, and put your trust in Allah. For verily, if Allah Wills good to occur, it will happen even if the entire world is against you.
