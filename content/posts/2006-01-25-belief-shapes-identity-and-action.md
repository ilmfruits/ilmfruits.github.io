In Surah Baqarah, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَإِذَا لَقُواْ الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُواْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَى شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُواْ <strong>إِنَّا مَعَكْمْ</strong> إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِؤُونَ
</div>

Translation: &#8220;When they meet those who believe, they **say** &#8216;we believe,&#8217; but when they are alone with their <span class="foreignWord">shayateen</span>, they say &#8216;**w****e are with you**&#8216; &#8230;&#8221; (Al-Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:14)<sup>1</sup>

Although the hypocrites _say_ they believe, they _associate their identities_ with <span class="foreignWords">shayateen</span> (devils, or &#8220;evil ones&#8221;).

<p class="gem">
  The lesson: your belief system shapes your identity.
</p>

As an example, consider <span class="foreignWords">zina</span> (fornication). Many people consider it a **positive attribute** to commit the act in ever-increasing numbers, because their football buddies or gossipy friends _believe_ this to be a good thing. However, **Muslims know** that zina, unrepented, entails severe, severe punishment in both lives, and the same attribute becomes **negative**.

Sound belief is **vital**&#8211;it shapes your identity and your actions.

<p class="gem">
  Believe that you are one of the people of <span class="foreignWords">Jannah</span> (paradise), and over time, you automatically reshape your actions to achieve that identity.
</p>

<p class="gem">
  Similarly, avoid beliefs that you are a &#8220;bad person&#8221; or &#8220;bad Muslim&#8221;, it motivates you towards ill-found actions.
</p>

May Allah protect us all from messed-up beliefs.
