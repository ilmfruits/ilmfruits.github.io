So, do you want to enter Jannah? Think about it for a second.

OK, that was an easy one. Here&#8217;s a more difficult question, how do you plan on getting there? Take your time and think about that one.

That thinking in and of itself will help you get to Jannah, inshallah ta&#8217;ala.

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will make the path easier for those who _sincerely_ desire to come closer to Him and find ways to do so.

Surely, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is the best of judges concerning ones sincerity towards Him as He says in the Qur&#8217;an:

<p align="center">
  <strong>&#8220;Say: Whether you hide what is in your hearts or you reveal it, Allah knows it all. He knows what is in the Heavens and what is on Earth. And Allah has power over all things&#8221;<br /> </strong><em>&#8211; Surah Al&#8217; Imran V.29</em>
</p>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is aware of everything and if you sincerely desire to come closer to Him, The All-Knowing and All-Hearing will inshallah ta&#8217;ala make it easy for you. Prophet Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم) has said that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) said in a hadith qudsi, _“If you come to Me walking, I will come to you running.”_ This is the compassion of The Most Merciful towards his believers, so never lose hope in Allah (سبحانه وتعالى).

In another [hadith qudsi][1], Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says, _&#8220;My servant does not come closer to Me with anything more dear to Me than that which I made obligatory upon him. My servant keeps coming closer to Me with more volunteer deeds, until I love him&#8230;&#8221;_ ****(Bukhari)

So, what are some practical benefits from this?

  1. **THINK.** Pondering about ways to achieve Jannah will only bring you closer to your goal. Thinking about the ways one can gain the pleasure of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is the initial &#8216;step&#8217;. Remember, you take that one step towards Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and He will come running to you. This is the promise of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) and He is The One who will never break a promise.
  2. **BE SINCERE.** Sincerely and whole-heartedly want to be closer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) for only His pleasure and no one else. This _ikhlas_ will bring baraqah to you and your goal.
  3. **OBSERVE THE FARD.** Do what Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) has commanded of you. Start with the obligatory salah and work your way up.
  4. **TRUE LOVE.** Take the time to do more nawafil and sunnah acts so that you may become among those that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) loves. Again, start with salah; perform the sunnah prayers, if you can, perform nawafil prayers and work your way up.
