In Islam, lying is haram (prohibited: to lie entails a sin, and to abstain from it enails good deeds). However, there are three circumstances in which a lie is allowed: for a husband to create love and tranqulity between himself and his wife, for one to settle disputes, and in war.

  1. **For a man to create harmony with his wife:** One may lie to one&#8217;s wife in order to create peace and avoid arguementation&#8211;for example, if one&#8217;s wife asks &#8220;do I looks fat and ugly?&#8221;, woe to the one who says &#8220;yes&#8221;.
  
    Beware that **lies to steal property or rights are haram by consensus!**
  2. **To settle disputes:** When two argue and stop speaking to each other and so on, one may lie to bring them together&#8211;for example, tell them each, seperately &#8220;hey, you know, the other guy says you&#8217;re _so awesome_, you&#8217;re like, his _hero_ man!&#8221; In this case, the action is _mustahab_ and one receives rewards for it.
  3. **In war:** in war, one may lie. For example, if captured as a prisoner of war, one may lie about Muslim armies, numbers, locations, strategies, etc. In this case, the action is _fard_, and must be carried out.

Wallahu &#8216;alim. When in doubt, ask people of knowledge.
