excerpt: "You can easily read six hours of Qur'an per day. How? Just read one minute at a time.  One minute, the time it takes to open three envelopes or peel a potato. It accumulates to six hours per year."

Everybody wants to read the Qur&#8217;an more&#8211;and why not? The Word of Allah, no less&#8211;unfiltered, unmodified, eternal; guidance for the entire planet. Yet many of us&#8211;even Arabs, who understand and have no problems reading and reciting&#8211;procrastinate and put off reading the Qur&#8217;an.

So try this inshaAllah: <span class="gem">every day, read and recite the Qur&#8217;an for at least one minute.</span> Try it. I mean, one minute is hardly time enough to do _anything_&#8211;so you have no excuse. RIGHT NOW, after you finish this post, pick up that dusty mushaf and give it one minute of attention that you _know_ it deserves.

And guess what? Minutes add up. 1 minute a day, x 365 days, becomes **six hours of Qur&#8217;an per year**&#8211;and all with no more effort then it takes to open three envelopes or peel a potato.

So what are you waiting for? Give it a try inshaAllah; pick a time you can do it, like after Maghrib salaah, and just go for it!

Six hours! Subhanallah, imagine that.
