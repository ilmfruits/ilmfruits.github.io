**Question:** What is the best way for a person increase his or her eman?

**Answerer:** Shaykh Yasir Qadhi

<p class="gem">
  The <strong>single greatest way to increase your eman </strong>is to <strong>gain knowledge</strong>.
</p>

Study what eman is, study _tawhid_, the pillars of eman, etc. It automatically increases your eman.

**Good deeds** also increase eman&#8211;<span class="gem">each and every single good deed and act of worship you perform increases your eman</span>. Fast a day. Read Qur&#8217;an. Pray Tahajjud.

And don&#8217;t forget to **make du&#8217;a**, for the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) made du&#8217;a that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) make his heart firm in Islam (i.e. increase his eman). It is narrated that he said: &#8220;o Controller of the Hearts, make my heart firm in Your faith.&#8221; [Ahmad]<sup>1</sup>

Also **study** the biographies and lives of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم), companions and of famous scholars. When you see all the things they did and the great trials they went through, it increases your eman.

And finally, **beware of sin**, for each and every sin and act you commit against Islam decreases your eman. Wasting time also decreases eman.

<p class="gem">
  People of eman <strong>don&#8217;t enjoy life quite the same way</strong> as other people&#8211;they&#8217;re always busy doing something.
</p>

Contemplate the creation and it&#8217;s perfection.

May Allah increase us all in our eman, and make firm our hearts on Islam. Ameen!
