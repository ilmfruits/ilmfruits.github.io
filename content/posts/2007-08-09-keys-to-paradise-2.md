&#8220;Whoever wishes to be delivered from the fire (of Hell) and enter the garden (of Paradise) should die with **faith in Allah and the Last Day** and **should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by them**.&#8221;
  
[Muhammad &#8211; Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم) as recorded in Sahih Muslim]

_1. Make a list of people you deal with:_

  * Parents
  * Friends
  * Co-workers

_2. Write how you would want to be treated in each of those roles:
  
_ 

  * I’d like to be respected and obeyed as a parent, and shown unconditional love by my kids
  * I’d like to be held in honor amongst my friends, I’d like them to listen to me, to respect me, to complement me on my good, to ignore my shortcomings and to give me sincere advice
  * I’d like to be heard, I’d like to be listened to and I’d like to be respected for my work

Viola! There is your to-do list from now onwards on how to deal with people! The recipe is simple: put yourself in the other&#8217;s shoes, and then ask: how would I want to be treated if I was that person? Then, treat them that way and in sha Allah, this is how you&#8217;ll be treated by them in response!

This is the way one can PERFECT their adaab. Whoever does this, and has complete iman in Allah (in statements and actions), then without a doubt Jannah will be their abode, in sha Allah.

I pray that Allah gives us all the tawfeeq to have complete Iman in Allah and to perfect our adaab by following the advise of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) as stated in the afore-mentioned hadith, ameen.
