Getting further in our discussion on the means to attain the utmost [purification in our salaah][1]; one of the best ways is to realize that it may be our last salaah we offer to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى). So the question is, how do you wanna go out?

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;_**Remember death in your prayer, for the man who remembers death during his prayer is bound to pray properly, and pray the prayer of a man who does not think that he will pray any other prayer.**_&#8221; (al-Silsilat al-Saheehah by al-Albaani, 1421. It was reported from al-Suyooti that al-Haafiz ibn Hajar classed this hadeeth as [hassan][2])

The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) also advised Abu Ayyoob (رضي الله عنه): &#8220;_**When you stand up to pray, pray a farewell prayer.**_&#8221; (Reported by Ahmad, 5/412; Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 742) &#8212; meaning the prayer of one who thinks that he will not pray another prayer.

The person who is praying will no doubt die, and there is some prayer that will be his last prayer, so let him have khushoo’ in the prayer that he is doing, for he does not know whether this will be his last prayer.

So when you&#8217;re standing, or in rukoo, or sujood, remember that this may be _**the last chance you ever get to pray to Allah**_ (سبحانه وتعالى). Make it **count.**
