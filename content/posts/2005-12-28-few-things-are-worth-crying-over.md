  &#8220;Very few things in life are worth crying over.&#8221;
</p>

Ponder it. Very few things in life are worth throwing a fit over or complaining about. In Islamic work, especially, people attach importantance to things that aren&#8217;t issues, tempers rise, fights break out, and brotherhood dies. And in the end, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) controls over all things.

So sit back, chill out, and let it run by you. No harm done, right?

Wallahu &#8216;alim.
