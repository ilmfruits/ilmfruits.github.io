In Surah Nisaa, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِئَتَيْنِ وَاللّهُ أَرْكَسَهُم بِمَا كَسَبُواْ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَهْدُواْ مَنْ أَضَلَّ اللّهُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلاً
</div>

**Translation:** What is the matter with you, then, that you have become two parties about the hypocrites, while Allah has made them return (to unbelief) for what they have earned? Do you wish to guide him whom Allah has caused to err? And whomsoever Allah causes to err, you shall by no means find a way for him. (Surah Nisaa, 4:88)<sup>1</sup>

There are two opinions on this surah. Both opinions are about there were those who called themselves Muslims&#8211;they prayed, they fasted, and everything else&#8211;but lived with their (pagan) tribes.

One opinion is that this verse was revealed in Meccan times. If the tribes plotted against the Muslims, those Muslims in them plotted too. They had their &#8220;feet in both boats&#8221;&#8211;if the Muslims lost, they stayed with the kufr tribe, and if the Muslims won, they would share in the victory. The problem with having your feet in two boats is that when they go in opposite directions, and you go down into the water.

The other opinion is that it was revealed in Medina. When the order to make <dfn title="migration">hijrah</dfn> came, those Muslims living with their (pagan) tribes refused to make <dfn title="migration">hijrah</dfn>.

In either case, the hypocrites seemed like true Muslims&#8211;they said shahada, they established prayer, they fasted, and fulfilled all the obligations. BUT, for their actions, Allah cast them into disbelief&#8211;because of the way they lived their lives, waging war on the Muslims when the tribe waged war. And in war, those who fought against the Muslims, whether they claimed to be Muslim or not, recieved no special treatment.

In our context, if the Islamic state emerges&#8211;it may happen in our great grandchildren&#8217;s time, or in our time, or at any time; Allah alone knowns when&#8211;and the call comes for <dfn title="migration">hijrah</dfn>, we must go or risk becoming the same type of people as this ayah describes. (Incidentally, one of the requirements of the Islamic state is that it can support the Muslim population.)

Even if the state does not arise in our lifetime, we must prepare our intentions, starting now.

May Allah preserve us from being among the hypocrites and the disbelievers.

And finally, when you consider the battle of Uhud, every sane, strong, able man went to fight&#8211;1000 men. 300 of them returned without fighting. 70 died in the battle. What happened? One-third of Muslims didn&#8217;t believe the way they should have believed.

As for that, guidance is from Allah. Whoever Allah misguides, none can guide.

May Allah protect us from being among those who earn misguidance as a result of out actions.
