[MadinahArabic.com][1] teaches Arabic in the style of the <font size="2" face="Verdana">Madinah Book Series, used to teach Arabic at </font>Al-Medina university. The series style caters to English-speakers. The website follows a similar teaching paradigm.

The course walks you through the process step by step. They seperate the material into two sections: Arabic Reading Course, which teaches letters, and Arabic Language Course, which teaches grammar and vocabulary.

The course offers a self-paced and comprehensive approach. They provide new sections every few months. If you can read and pronounce your letters properly, I recommend you try the online courses.
