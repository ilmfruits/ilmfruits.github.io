  The Shepherd&#8217;s Path
</div>

[The Shepherd&#8217;s Path][1] is an AlMaghrib Institute course taught by Muhammad Alshareef.

While many of us claim to love the Messenger of Allah (صلي الله عليه وسلم), few of us follow his path, and fewer still know more then snatches of information about him. How did he live, and how did he die? What key lesson did the angel Jibreel send by squeezing him three times before the first revelation? What deep and profound lessons can we learn and apply from his life, to our current situation? What would he do if he were in our position today?

Don&#8217;t know the answers? Well, read on inshaAllah and find out!
