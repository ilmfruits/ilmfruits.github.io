Madd (pronounced like &#8220;mud&#8221;), literally means &#8220;extension&#8221;. In recitation of the Qur&#8217;an (tajweed), madd is when you extend and stretch a vowel sound (aah, ooh, etc.).

There are two types of madd: **fard** (obligatory: you _have_ to recite it) and **mustahab** (recommended: you _should_ recite it). <span class="gem">The general rule is that a madd inside a word is fard, while a madd that connects two words is mustahab.</span>

For example, in Surah Baqarah, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ <strong>هَؤُلاء</strong> إِنْ كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ
</div>

**Translation:** Reveal the names if you are true. [Surah Baqarah, verse 31]

the word <dfn title="haa`ulaa`i">[هَؤُلاء]</dfn> contains two madh in the middle of the word (they are part of the word)&#8211;so you should **always** extend them in your recitation.

Meanwhile, in another verse of Surah Baqarah, Allah says:

<div class="quran">
  وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ <strong>بِمَا أُنْزِلَ</strong> إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَبِالآخرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** Those who believe in **what was revealed** to them and what was revealed before them and in the Akhira they have certainty. [Surah Baqarah, verse 4]**
  
** 

Here, we see a madd that connects two words, <dfn title="maa">[مَا]</dfn> and <dfn title="oonzila">[أُنْزِلَ]</dfn>, so it is **recommended** to extend the alif sound.

Also, madd most commonly occurs when you have an alif, waw, or ya, followed by a hamza&#8211;these vowels recieve madd.

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alim.
