The word &#8220;du&#8217;a&#8221; is the verbal noun of the verb &#8220;da&#8217;a&#8221;, which means &#8220;to call out, to summon.&#8221;

With that said, du&#8217;a is a fundamental aspect of Islam, and without it, one&#8217;s eman cannot be intact. Allah mentions du&#8217;a in the Qur&#8217;an to signify many things, such as:

  * Worship: <div align="center" class="quran">
      وَلاَ <strong>تَدْعُ</strong> مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنْفَعُكَ وَلاَ يَضُرُّكَ
    </div>
    
    <div align="center">
      <strong>Translation: </strong>&#8220;And <strong>do not call</strong> besides Allah that which will not harm you or benefit you&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Yunus, 10:106].
    </div>

  * Praise: <div align="center" class="quran">
      يَوْمَ <strong>يَدْعُو</strong>كُمْ
    </div>
    
    <div align="center">
      <strong>Translation: </strong>&#8220;The Day that <strong>you will be called</strong>&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Isra, 17:52]
    </div>

  * The seeking of aid: <div align="center" class="quran">
      وَا<strong>دْعُوا</strong> شُهَدَاءَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ
    </div>
    
    <div align="center">
      <strong>Translation: </strong>&#8220;And <strong>call upon</strong> your witness besides Allah&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Baqarah, 2:23]
    </div>

As for the Islamic meaning of the word du&#8217;a, many scholars defined it in similar ways.

Ibn al-Qayyim defined it as, &#8220;asking what is of benefit to the person, and asking the removal of what is harming him, or (asking) the repelling of it (before it afflicts him).&#8221; [Bada&#8217;i al-Fawa&#8217;id, 3/2]

Muhammad al-Sayed Tantawi defined it as, &#8220;the appeal to Allah, all Glory be to Him, of a request, by asking Him, with desire for all good that is with Him, and to be submissive to Him in asking what is desired, and in obtaining what is hoped for.&#8221; [Kitab ad-Du&#8217;a]

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) is surely _**the**_** _greatest_**, and we _**must** ****_thank Him for His bounties upon us. Think about it&#8211;what would our condition be like if we didn&#8217;t have Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) to turn to? If Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) didn&#8217;t give us the power of du&#8217;a where would we go in times of need? Inshallah ta&#8217;ala we are able to truly look to Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) for everything, and always make constant du&#8217;a to Him.
