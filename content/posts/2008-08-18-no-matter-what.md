<p style="text-align: left;">
  Asalamu &#8216;alaikum,
</p>

Time comes and goes; some people grow, some people remain exactly same throughout time.

<span style="font-size: x-large;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span>
  
_By the Time!_

إِ<span style="font-size: x-large;">نَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span>**_
  
_** _Indeed! Mankind is in loss_**__**

Thus, Allah makes clear that by the passing time man is in complete loss. Why? Because they don&#8217;t take heed, they don&#8217;t learn, they don&#8217;t listen, they go on doing what their hearts desire without thinking twice. They (in general) don&#8217;t ponder about the real purpose of their life; they (in general) cover reality with their false notions and desires.

O Muslims! Allah says:
  
 <span style="font-size: x-large;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ<br /> </span>
  
_And I have not created the Jinn and Human beings except to worship Me (51:56)****_

The ultimate purpose of our life is to worship the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Does this mean that Allah needs us to worship Him? **No!** Allah says:

<span style="font-size: x-large;">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</span>
  
_Say: He is Allah! The One and Only_

<span style="font-size: x-large;">اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ<br /> </span>_Allah, the Self-Sufficient
  
**
  
**_ Allah is self-sufficient. He is not in _need_ of anything; He is independent from us while we are completely dependent upon Him. Allah says after making clear our purpose of creation:****

<span style="font-size: x-large;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span>
  
_I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me_.
  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /> إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span>
  
_Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most <span style="font-size: x-small;">Strong.</span>****_

So, Allah does not need anything from us. Rather, it is Allah who is the All-Providing, the Sustainer, the Nourisher. Thus, we are completely dependent upon Him. And so we worship Allah because truly He alone is worthy of worship; He alone possesses the qualities which inately drive us to worship Him. It is only He who is able to answer our calls when in distress; it is He who has created the heavens and the earth; it is He who merges the night into the day and the day into the night; it is He who has provided fruits, vegetables, and cattle for our sustenance; it is He who makes the rain fall from the sky; it is He who showers His Mercy onto all of mankind regardless of their believing in Him; it is He who is al-Wadood, the Most Loving; it is He who is al-Ghafoor, the Most Forgiving; it is He who is ar-Razzaq, the All-Provider; it is He who is al-Mussawir, the Bestower of forms; it is He who is ar-Ra&#8217;uf, the Most Kind; it is He who is Maleekee Yawmee&#8217;deen, the Master and Owner of the Day of Judgment.

O Muslims! What has preoccupied us from the worship of Allah? From the purpose of our creation? Allah tells us:

<span style="font-size: x-large;">أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ</span>
  
_The mutual rivalry for piling up wordly things diverts you_

<span style="font-size: x-large;">حَتَّى زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ</span>
  
_(It will do so) Until you visit the graves (i.e. till you die)_
  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /> كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ</span>
  
_Nay! You shall come to know!_
  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /> ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ</span>
  
_Again, Nay! You shall come to know!_

Remember, this life is a test and know with certainty that you will meet Allah. We all want to gain Paradise. We all want to run away from the punishment of the Hellfire. Know O Slave of Allah! <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No matter what you have done in the past</strong></span>, you can always return to Allah. The contentment of the heart resides in this.

<span style="font-size: x-large;">وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُواْ لِي وَلْيُؤْمِنُواْ بِي لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ</span>
  
_And when My servants ask you concerning Me &#8211; indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided._
  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /> وَإِنِّي لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</span>
  
_But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.
  
_ <span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /> إِلَّا مَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلاً صَالِحاً فَأُوْلَئِكَ يُبَدِّلُ اللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ حَسَنَاتٍ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</span>
  
_Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful._
