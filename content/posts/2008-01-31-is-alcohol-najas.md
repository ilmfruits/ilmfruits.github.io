excerpt: "Is alcohol najas? While scholars disagreed, all for madhahib say it IS najas.  Why? Because of the ayah in Surah Ma'idah--alcohol, divination, and gambling are rijs (filth).  Filth is najas by default!  And the hadith of washing the inaa' of the people of the book--inaa' refers to plates and bowls and utensils, but also cups!  Why mention cups?  Alcohol!"

The word &#8220;khamr&#8221; in Arabic refers to intoxicants (in general), but also specifically to alcohol. We all know drinking alcohol is haraam&#8211;but is alcohol itself najas? People use alcohol in medicine, in lens-cleaners, even in foods. What have scholars said about this?

**Summary:** Allahu &#8216;alim, both sides&#8211;those that say alcohol is najas, and those that don&#8217;t&#8211;have strong proofs. Having said that, **all four madhahib say alcohol is najas**. The main proof&#8211;and there are a few proofs&#8211;is the ayah:

<div class="quran">
  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالأَنصَابُ وَالأَزْلاَمُ <strong>رِجْسٌ</strong> مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** O you who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are **rijs** of Shaytan&#8217;s handwork; eschew such (filth), that ye may prosper. [Surah Ma&#8217;idah, verse 90]

The word Allah uses&#8211;rijs&#8211;means filth, which is najas by default. Gambling and divination are spirituall najas, and alcohol is physically najas! (Those who say alcohol is not najas use this ayah too&#8211;gambling and divination are _spiritually_ najas. If you walk into a gambling machine, you don&#8217;t go wash it off! And alcohol is mentioned here too. But the refutal is that it&#8217;s _common sense_ that gambling and divination aren&#8217;t physically najas.)

Another proof: Abu Tha&#8217;labah Al-Khushani asked the Prophet: &#8220;We are in a land inhabited by people of the book. Can we eat from their _inaa&#8217;_?&#8221; The Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat from them, unless you can&#8217;t find an alternative; in that case, wash them and eat from them.&#8221; The word used, inaa&#8217;, refers to dishes (plates, bowls), utensils (knives, forks, spoons), AND cups! If alcohol wasn&#8217;t najas, the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) wouldn&#8217;t have mentioned inaa&#8217;, only plates/bowls/etc. and utensils! So the majority of scholars use this proof, too, to say alcohol is najas.

And follow Imam Malik&#8211;who says that even though alcohol is najas, if it&#8217;s mixed into something&#8211;as long as it doesn&#8217;t change the colour, smell, or taste of the thing&#8211;then that thing is pure.

But don&#8217;t cook with it&#8211;because there&#8217;s a hadith, that &#8220;whatever intoxicates in large amounts is haraam even in small amounts.&#8221;

Wallahu ta&#8217;ala &#8216;alim.
