excerpt: "The Prophet used to make du'a and seek Allah's protection from LAZINESS, and from INCAPABILITY. Why? What's so bad about these two things? Surprisingly, they can impact all aspects of your life--dunya AND akhirah--if left unmanaged."

The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) used to make a du&#8217;a:

<blockquote style="hadith">
  <p>
    اللّهُمَّ إنِّي أعُوذُبِكَ مِن العَجزِ وَ الكَسلٍ</blockquote > <strong>Transliteration:</strong> Allahumma inniy a&#8217;oothubika min al-ajzi wal-kasli<br /> <strong>Translation:</strong> O Allah, I seek refuge in you from incapability and laziness.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why is this du&#8217;a important? For two reasons:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Laziness is an attribute of munafiqeen. If this wasn&#8217;t bad enough, being lazy leads to procrastination, which leads to its own set of problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      It&#8217;s common these days for people to say &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; Like &#8220;I can&#8217;t pray at work,&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t achieve X.&#8221; The Prophet (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) would say a&#8217;oothubillah to that kind of talk. Think about it!
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Action Plan:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Memorize this du&#8217;a and make it every day in your sujood in every salaah.</strong> You have the Arabic, transliteration, and translation&#8211;you have no excuse not to do it!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Share your tips.</strong> What other tips and tricks do you use to overcome laziness and procrastination? Let us know in the comments!
