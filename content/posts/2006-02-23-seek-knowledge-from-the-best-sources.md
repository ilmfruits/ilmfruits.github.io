<p class="gem">
  When you seek knowledge, seek from the best sources&#8211;the most authentic, and those closest to the source.
</p>

The companion Abdullah ibn Zubayr (رضي الله عنه) was 10 years old when the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) went on his farewell Hajj. Abdullah ibn Zubayr went, too, and witnessed the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam)&#8217;s hajj _first-hand_.

After the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) passed away, Abdullah ibn Zubayr became **the definitive source** of the fiqh of Hajj&#8211;starting at age 10&#8211;until he passed away at 73.

Why? Because he witnessed the Hajj of the prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم) **first-hand**. He saw it all himself.

The same thing happened to &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها), the wife of the Prophet (صلي الله عليه وسلم). In matters that deal with and around family life, her statements are taken as _the_ source. So if what she says conflicts with another companion&#8217;s statement, her statement overrides.

We don&#8217;t all have companions or <dfn title="shaykhs and people of knowledge">shuyook</dfn> to teach us. So seek knowledge **wherever it may be**&#8211;those who have learned from people of knowledge or students of knowledge can pass on what they know. And share what little you know.

And remember, it&#8217;s **fard** for Muslims to seek knowledge about their deen, at least with the basic obligations and prohibitions.
  
May Allah allow us all to fulfil the obligation of seeking knowledge. Ameen.
