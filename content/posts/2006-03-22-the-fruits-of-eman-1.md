Allah says in the Qur’an, in Surah Ibrahim:

<div class="quran">
  أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ اللّهُ مَثَلاً كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاء<br /> تُؤْتِي أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا وَيَضْرِبُ اللّهُ الأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** Have you not seen how Allah has given the parable of a beautiful <dfn title="la ilaha ilallah">kalimah</dfn>, like a beautiful tree whose roots are firmly established, and whose branches tower in the sky? **It gives its fruits at all times by the permission of it&#8217;s Lord**, and Allah sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember. (Surah Ibrahim, verse 24-25)<sup>1</sup>

We discussed in the previous entry, the parable of the tree that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) sets forth in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says here that the tree of <dfn title="belief">eman</dfn> is ever fruitful&#8211;unlike other trees that fruit only at specific times (once a year, twice a year, etc.) this tree is always fruitful.

<p class="gem">
  And it is only the tree of <dfn title="belief">eman</dfn> that is perpetually fruitful.
</p>

Now, you might ask, what are the fruits of this tree&#8211;the fruits of <dfn title="belief">eman</dfn>? There are many&#8211;I know only 20&#8211;so inshaAllah we will discuss them over a series of entries.

Bismillah.

<div class="miniTitle">
  1) Jannah / Paradise
</div>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in Surah Kahf:

<div class="quran">
  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ الْفِرْدَوْسِ نُزُلًا
</div>

**Translation:** As to those who believe and work righteous deeds, they shall have many <dfn title="gardens">jannat</dfn> in <dfn title="the highest level of Paradise">firdaus</dfn> (Surah Kahf, verse 107)<sup>1</sup>

Those who believe (the word is &#8220;amana&#8221;), they shall have Paradise. So Paradise is one of the fruits of eman!

<div class="miniTitle">
  2) Protection from Hellfire
</div>

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, in one hadith: Whoever said &#8220;La ilaha ilallah&#8221; and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a barley grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said &#8220;La ilaha ilallah&#8221; and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a wheat grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said &#8220;La ilaha ilallah&#8221; and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of an atom will be taken out of Hell.&#8221; [[Bukhari 1/2/21][1]]<sup>2</sup>

<p class="gem">
  This hadith shows, explicitly, that there are different levels of eman (that&#8217;s a topic of another entry). And eman protects you from Hellfire&#8211;whether from a permanent stay (may Allah protect us from that) or all-together.
</p>

<div class="miniTitle">
  3) The Key to Acceptance of Good Deeds
</div>

Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says in Isra:

<div class="quran">
  وَمَنْ أَرَادَ الآخِرَةَ وَسَعَى لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُورًا
</div>

**Translation:** Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter, and strive therefor with all due striving, and have Faith &#8211; they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to Allah). <dfn title="the highest level of Paradise">(Surah Isra, verse 19)<sup>1</sup></dfn>

This shows that eman&#8211;belief in the Hereafter&#8211;is the key to having your good deeds accepted.

<p class="gem">
  Which raises the question&#8211;what about non-Muslims? There are those who build hospitals, feed orphans, etc. They believe in Allah, perhaps in a different way then we do (such as the mushrikeen of Arabia during the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him). Will their reward go in vain? If Allah is just(سبحانه وتعالى) how can he let their good deeds go in vain?
</p>

<p class="gem">
  The answer is that they <em>do</em> receive rewards from Allah&#8211;but in this life, only, and not the Hereafter. Wallahu &#8216;alim.
