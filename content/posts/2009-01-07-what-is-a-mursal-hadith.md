In the sciences of hadith, there&#8217;s something called a &#8220;mursal&#8221; hadith. What exactly is a mursal hadith? What is it&#8217;s status? What are the fiqh rulings on mursal ahadith? And why does it matter?

(Ok, for the answer to the last question, read and learn about the science of hadith. In a sentence: Scholars have devised an extremely rigorous process to determine which hadith are authentic, and which are not. You wouldn&#8217;t want to spend your whole life following a &#8220;hadith,&#8221; only to find out it really _wasn&#8217;t_ legit, do you?)

A mursal hadith is a hadith where the chain only goes up to a tabi&#8217;ee. (So the hadith goes: X narrated, from Y, from Z, &#8230; from such-and-such a tabi&#8217;een.) Tabi&#8217;een are the generation after the companions&#8211;they are the sons and daughters and followers of Islam who came after the sahaba. Most hadith continue&#8211;the tabi&#8217;ee will narrate from a sahaba, who will narrate directly from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).

So mursal ahadith are ahadith where the chain cuts off at the tab&#8217;iee level; it doesn&#8217;t go directly to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).

And why is this important? Because _a tabi&#8217;ee can narrate from another tabi&#8217;ee!_ It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that they heard it _directly_ from a sahaba, who heard it from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).

So the ruling on mursal ahadith? **They are considered as da&#8217;eef ahadith**. All the same rulings apply.

For example, in the issue of &#8220;does laughing in salaah break your wudoo?,&#8221; imam Abu Hanifa says yes, and cites a _mursal hadith_ as his proof. The majority of scholars disagree, and insha&#8217;Allah this is the correct opinion&#8211;why?

Because the hadith is mursal (i.e. da&#8217;eef), and it contradicts shari&#8217;ah principles&#8211;why would it break your wudoo _inside_ salaah, but not if you laugh _outside_ salaah? (And these are not the only proofs; only a taste of the discussion.)

Wallahu &#8216;alam.
