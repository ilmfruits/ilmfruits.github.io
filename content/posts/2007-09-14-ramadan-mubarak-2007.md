Ramadan Mubarak! May Allah allow us all to take the most benefit out of this month, when the good deeds (but also the bad deeds) are multiplied!

The companions&#8211;may Allah be pleased with all of them&#8211;used to ask Allah for 6 months to accept their last Ramadan, and ask Allah for 6 months to allow them to live to see the next Ramadan.

THAT&#8217;S Ramadan for you!

And remember, <span class="gem">if you&#8217;re fasting, but not praying the fards&#8211;or you&#8217;re praying taraweeh, but skipping Fajr, Dhur, Asr, Maghrib, or Isha&#8211;you have a big problem.</span> Fasting and praying are both fard, and neither should be neglected; and taraweeh is not even fard, so why are you trading it for a fard!

Pick up the pace, and start praying your faraaid&#8211;once, twice, three times, four times, until you hit your daily five. Make that your goal&#8211;to establish salaah by the end of Ramadan.

Avoid things that eat from your fast, like backbiting, eating intentionally, lying, and so on.

We ask Allah to make us among those whose Islam rises every Ramadan to new heights, ya rabbil alameen! AMEEN!
