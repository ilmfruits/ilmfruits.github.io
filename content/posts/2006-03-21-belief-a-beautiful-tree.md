Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an, in Surah Ibrahim:

<div class="quran">
  أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ اللّهُ مَثَلاً كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاء<br /> تُؤْتِي أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا وَيَضْرِبُ اللّهُ الأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ
</div>

**Translation:** Have you not seen how Allah has given the parable of a beautiful <dfn title="la ilaha ilallah">kalimah</dfn>, like a beautiful tree whose roots are firmly established, and whose branches tower in the sky? &#8230; Allah sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember. (Surah Ibrahim, verse 24-25)<sup>1</sup>

Look at all the images embedded in this metaphor. Trees produce fruit, wood for houses, shade, shelter.

And more then that&#8211;oxygen! Trees are the fundamental building block of the ecosystem!

&#8220;roots are firmly established&#8221; means strength and stability. Think of hurricanes&#8211;when they hit, they uproot weaker trees. Trees with good roots remain firm. Eman is like that&#8211;it keeps you firm. And like the tree, once eman enters the heart, it doesn&#8217;t leave. (Consider the scholars&#8211;never in the history of the ummah has one left the deen. Scholars of other religions leave them all the time&#8211;for Islam. A <dfn title="one who has memorized the Qur'an">hafidh</dfn> never leaves Islam. Even non-practicing Muslims never doubt their faith. Those who leave, they were never really, truly Muslims.)

&#8220;Branches tower in the sky&#8221; shows that the larger the tree, the more benefits&#8211;the more oxygen, the more shade, the more fruit.

May Allah give us understanding of His parables and allow us to remember them. Ameen.
