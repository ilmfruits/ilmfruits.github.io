Not enough time to do what you want in life? Are you over-worked, over-stressed, and over-tired? Looking for that one key element that&#8217;ll make everything fall into place time-wise?

<p class="gem">
  Schedule around <dfn title="the daily prayers">salaah</dfn>.
</p>

Try it&#8211;plan your day around your salaah. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do x, y, z after Fajr.&#8221; &#8220;I can fit these things in before Dhur &#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Sorry bro, I can&#8217;t meet up until after Isha&#8221; etc.

And see the difference it makes. Just try it. (It&#8217;s a prophetic technique.)

Inshallah do post in the comments if it makes any kind of difference in your life.
